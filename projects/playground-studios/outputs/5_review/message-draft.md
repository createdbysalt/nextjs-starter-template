# Client Message: Post-Audit Update

**To:** Barrett Shutt (Playground Studios)
**From:** Salt Studio
**Re:** Website strategy complete - a few items needed before design

---

Hey Barrett,

We just finished the strategy and design direction phase for the Playground Studios site - everything is looking great. Did a full conversion audit and the site scored **8.4/10** for conversion readiness. No major issues, just a few things we need from you before we start building.

## 3 things we need before launch:

### 1. Testimonials (most important)

Can you reach out to 3-5 past clients for quick testimonials? Celsius, Brumate, Samsung, Kendra Scott, or MVMT would be ideal. We just need their name, title, company, and 1-2 sentences about working with you.

Here's a template you can use:

> *"Hey [Name], hope you're doing well! I'm launching a new website for Playground Studios and would love to feature a brief testimonial if you're open to it. Just 1-2 sentences about your experience working together - the process, quality of work, or results. No pressure either way!"*

### 2. Logo usage confirmation

Can you confirm you have permission to display these client logos on your website?

- Celsius
- Brumate
- Bulletproof
- Samsung
- Kendra Scott
- MVMT
- Liquid IV
- Michelob Ultra

Just let me know which ones are good to use. If you have logo files (SVG or PNG), that would be helpful too.

### 3. Headshot

When will the updated headshot be ready? If it won't be done in time, we can use an existing professional photo - just let me know.

## Not urgent but helpful:

- How many portfolio projects will be ready at launch? (We're planning for 6-10)
- Quick approval on homepage headline direction - we're pairing something aspirational with a clear subhead like "Creative production studio specializing in photography and video for brands"

Let me know if you have any questions!
