## Executive Summary

Your approved copy is excellent and captures Barrett's authentic voice perfectly. We've made minimal optimizations focused on three areas:

1. **SEO** - Meta titles and descriptions for better search visibility
2. **AEO** - FAQ schema for voice search (Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa)
3. **Conversion** - Small clarity improvements based on conversion audit

**All original approved copy is preserved.** Changes are either additive (SEO/AEO) or minor refinements clearly flagged for your review.

## Decisions Needed from Client

### 1. Homepage Subheadline
**Decision:** Keep original or use optimized version?

**Original (35 words):**
> "At Playground Studios, we transform ideas into vibrant, impactful experiences. We're a dynamic production company specializing in photography, videography, and branded content that elevates your vision."

**Optimized (21 words):**
> "Photography and video production for brands ready to stand out. From concept to final delivery, we bring bold ideas to life."

**Recommendation:** Optimized for faster comprehension, but either works.

---

### 2. Location Display
**Decision:** Confirm location format for contact page and meta descriptions.

**Option A (Per your note):**
> "USA. Available worldwide."

**Option B (Dual city):**
> "Based in Louisville & Portland. Available for projects nationwide."

**Your original note said:** "Since I moved to Kentucky, I want to be anonymous really in location. Can we do, USA. Available worldwide?"

**Recommendation:** Go with Option A per your preference.

---

### 3. Pricing Ranges
**Decision:** Confirm these ranges are accurate for public display.

Currently using:
- Starting: $5,000-$8,000
- Sweet spot: $8,000-$15,000
- Larger productions: Scale from there

These appear on the Services page and in FAQ schema.

---

### 4. Contact Form Budget Field
**Decision:** Keep required, make optional, or remove?

**Current:** Required dropdown

**Concern:** May cause friction - some leads abandon forms when asked about budget before conversation.

**Options:**
- A) Keep as required (qualifies leads)
- B) Make optional (reduces friction)
- C) Remove (ask in discovery call instead)

**Recommendation:** Option B - Make optional

---

### 5. Testimonials (Priority)
**Decision:** Provide 3-5 testimonials before launch

This is the single highest-impact improvement identified in the conversion audit. The site has great visual proof (portfolio, logos) but no voice-of-customer proof.

**Ideal testimonials would address:**
- Quality of the work
- What it's like working with Barrett/Playground
- Meeting deadlines
- Value delivered

**Suggested contacts:**
- Celsius
- Samsung
- Brumate
- MVMT
- Kendra Scott

**Format needed:**
> "[Quote about experience/results]"
> - Name, Title at Company
