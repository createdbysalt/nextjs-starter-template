# Client Message: Post-Discovery Update

**To:** Barrett Shutt (Playground Studios)
**From:** Salt Studio
**Re:** Discovery complete - confirming a few details

---

Hey Barrett,

We've completed the discovery phase for Playground Studios and have a solid foundation to build from. Before we move into audience research and site architecture, I want to confirm a few things and get some items from you.

## Decisions we've documented (please confirm):

1. **Voice:** Using "we" (agency voice) throughout the site
2. **Location:** Dual presence - Portland & Kentucky markets (not highlighting the move)
3. **Brand feel:** Subtle playfulness with mature visual execution
4. **Pricing:** $5K minimum, $8K-$15K sweet spot

If any of these don't feel right, let me know and we can adjust.

## Items we need from you:

### High Priority (before we can finalize strategy):

**1. Testimonials**
Can you reach out to 3-5 past clients for quick testimonials? We need: name, title, company, and 1-2 sentences about working with you.

Best contacts to ask: Celsius, Brumate, Samsung, Kendra Scott, MVMT

Template you can use:
> *"Hey [Name], hope you're doing well! I'm launching a new website for Playground Studios and would love to feature a brief testimonial if you're open to it. Just 1-2 sentences about your experience working together. No pressure either way!"*

**2. Logo Usage Rights**
Can you confirm permission to display these client logos on your website?
- Celsius, Brumate, Bulletproof, Samsung, Kendra Scott, MVMT, Liquid IV, Michelob Ultra

**3. Updated Headshot**
When will this be ready? Or should we use an existing photo?

### Medium Priority:

**4. Portfolio Inventory**
How many projects will be ready at launch with full image sets (6+ images each)?

**5. Success Metrics**
Six months after launch, what numbers would make you say "this website is working"? (inquiries per month, booked clients, etc.)

## What's next:

Once we have the above, we'll move into:
1. Audience profiles (who we're designing for)
2. Site architecture (pages and structure)
3. Design direction (visual system)

Let me know if you have any questions!
