I am solo freelance and still in the beginning of stages of my own business. The idea ""Playground"" came to me on a walk one day in Northwest. I was in the middle of work, super stressed and I would frequently go on walks. These walks helped my creative drive. I was on a walk and looked over and saw a bunch of kids on break playing at the playground. My first thought was like ""wow I'm old."" and my second thought was reminiscing on the days that stress, career, and life challenges did not exist. The days when you played pretend and dreamed big. I remember I wanted to be a professional soccer player. At that age, anything seemed possible or could be a reality. The playground was where kids dreamed, created and imagined. This idea stuck with me and I thought it could be great name for my agency. Theres a fun play on words and untimely want to create an experience and delver a great product. ","I think what makes my approach unique is the experience. We offer seamless commutation, tight deadlines, and quality work. We strive to work within any budget and the end goal to take an idea and bring it to reality. We are easy to work with and unlike big agencies, we don't have many hurtles to jump over. "," creative, bold, authentic ","overpriced, late, poor communication ","inspired, creative, and think ""wow this company is super sick."" ","lifestyle/studio photography, videography, branding. ","I would love to create a company that has retaining clients and have a team. I would love to shoot for brands like (sazerac, Malbon golf/7 eleven golf, and more). I would love to expand and even have other creative outlets like clothing, branding studio, and design. I love fashion and can see something involve down the line. Right now my goal is create a life of freedom and flexibility.
