# Design Inspiration - Playground Studios

## Brand Vision & Concept

**Core Concept**: The "Playground" concept stems from Barrett's epiphany during a walk in Northwest Portland, watching kids play stress-free at a playground. The brand represents a return to that creative freedom where "anything seemed possible" - a space for dreaming, creating, and imagining.

**Brand Tagline**: "Play, Innovate, Create"

**Process Philosophy**:
- "Play on Set" (ideation)
- "Get in the Box" (focused execution)
- "Go Home" (delivering work you're proud of)

## Visual Direction

### Brand Personality
- **Descriptive Words**: Creative, bold, authentic
- **Anti-Brand**: Overpriced, late, poor communication
- **Desired Feeling**: Inspired, creative, "wow this company is super sick"

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Black and white
- **Supporting**: Stone grey, bone
- **Direction**: Clean, neutral palette with white background and black typography

### Typography & Style
- **Aesthetic**: Bold typography aesthetic
- **Approach**: Clean, minimal design
- **Feel**: Brief and to the point
