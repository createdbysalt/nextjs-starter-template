### Summary

Barrett Shutt and SALT STUDIO discussed project progress, with Barrett Shutt mentioning a move to Louisville, Kentucky, and expressing excitement for the "Playground" project despite limited usable video content due to legal constraints. SALT STUDIO suggested a multi-layer filter for organizing Barrett Shutt's various types of photography and advised targeting both Portland and Kentucky in SEO efforts to maximize visibility, which aligns with Barrett Shutt’s goal of creating a cohesive brand platform to attract "bigger brands." Barrett Shutt also provided feedback on the initial logo concepts, leaning toward a simplified, abstract, and less playful design, and granted SALT STUDIO freedom to optimize the website's visual elements, prompting SALT STUDIO to confirm that wireframe work and logo revisions are scheduled for the next week, aiming to meet the original end-of-January deadline.

### Details

*Notes Length: Standard*

* **Holiday Recap and Moving** Barrett Shutt and SALT STUDIO briefly discussed their recent holidays, noting they were good ([00:00:00](#00:00:00)). Barrett Shutt also mentioned the recent move back to Louisville, Kentucky, where they are originally from, after living in California and Oregon for a long time ([00:01:45](#00:01:45)). They acknowledged that the move felt strange at first, feeling like a temporary holiday return, but is now adjusting ([00:02:34](#00:02:34)).

* **Project Progress and Content Strategy** Barrett Shutt expressed excitement about the Playground project, acknowledging that some work had been delayed. They explained that they have less usable video work for the website due to legal constraints, which means the platform might initially feel more "photoheavy" ([00:03:24](#00:03:24)) ([00:16:43](#00:16:43)). They are strategically thinking through the look and feel of the website, aiming for a structure that can adapt to future changes ([00:04:25](#00:04:25)).

* **Copy Review and Tone of Voice** Barrett Shutt praised SALT STUDIO's work on the website copy, noting that SALT STUDIO successfully captured their verbiage and tone of voice. They indicated minimal changes to the copy were needed, primarily simplifying a couple of things and noting missing elements like an updated photo ([00:04:25](#00:04:25)). SALT STUDIO confirmed the copy looked good and acknowledged the frustration over the limited work Barrett Shutt can put on the site due to legal issues ([00:05:21](#00:05:21)).

* **Work Organization and User Experience** Barrett Shutt sought advice on how to best showcase their different types of photography—lifestyle/brands, studio, and hospitality (including food within hospitality)—without creating an excessive number of clicks ([00:05:21](#00:05:21)). They want the website to be user-friendly and easy to navigate ([00:06:27](#00:06:27)). SALT STUDIO suggested a multi-layer filter for organizing services and categories like hotels ([00:09:43](#00:09:43)).

* **Branding Focus and SEO Strategy** Barrett Shutt expressed interest in highlighting brand work the most, as it is the type of work they are more intrigued to pursue ([00:07:25](#00:07:25)). SALT STUDIO advised that breaking up content with a multi-layer filter and specific categories would be beneficial for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), increasing visibility and attracting more clients ([00:09:43](#00:09:43)) ([00:13:31](#00:13:31)).

* **Website Goal and Client Attraction** Barrett Shutt clarified that the overall goal of the website is to create a cohesive, quality brand platform that attracts and builds clients, ultimately leading to opportunities to shoot for "bigger brands" ([00:12:10](#00:12:10)). The website is intended to be a centralized pitch tool for services, including photography, when reaching out to potential clients ([00:13:31](#00:13:31)).

* **Content Granularity for Visibility** Barrett Shutt realized that being more specific about their work, such as listing hotels and campaigns, would improve visibility, aligning with SALT STUDIO’s recommendation ([00:14:35](#00:14:35)). They mentioned an upcoming small studio shoot for Kendra Scott jewelry as an example of brand work they wish to feature prominently, even if it is a "smaller campaign" ([00:15:37](#00:15:37)).

* **Image Preparation and File Organization** Barrett Shutt is currently going through the tedious process of compressing old JPEG images for the web to ensure fast loading times without significant quality loss ([00:18:41](#00:18:41)). They acknowledged being an unorganized creative and emphasized that this project is helping them become more organized by standardizing file preparation and storage ([00:19:47](#00:19:47)).

* **Flow of Website Copy and Visuals** Barrett Shutt found the flow of the copy for the website to be great and straightforward ([00:21:55](#00:21:55)). They confirmed that the featured client section is expected to function as a horizontal moving display of logos. Barrett Shutt expressed trust in SALT STUDIO's expertise for visual elements and layout optimization, granting them the freedom to make adjustments that improve efficiency and aesthetics ([00:23:01](#00:23:01)).

* **Logo Feedback and Revisions** Barrett Shutt provided feedback on the initial logo concepts, noting some were "too playful" and suggesting a less playful, simplified, and slightly more abstract approach ([00:23:54](#00:23:54)) ([00:31:17](#00:31:17)). They liked the font and text play in the third concept, suggesting a more mature look that avoids being overly playful despite the "Playground" name ([00:27:22](#00:27:22)). They favored the style of the "Bandit" example, particularly its straightforward font combined with a subtly curved icon, and leaned towards refining the original 'P' icon concept or an abstract teeter-totter symbol ([00:28:49](#00:28:49)).

* **Design Aesthetics and Project Timeline** SALT STUDIO observed that Barrett Shutt's preferred examples generally feature "linear" and "straight edges," suggesting the website design should lean toward that style ([00:32:30](#00:32:30)) ([00:34:43](#00:34:43)). SALT STUDIO confirmed that they will begin working on the wireframe next week and aim to send an update by Friday ([00:23:54](#00:23:54)). They are also working with the designer on second revisions of the logos and plan to share a solid concept next week ([00:35:44](#00:35:44)). SALT STUDIO anticipates still meeting the original end-of-January deadline due to utilizing new AI tools ([00:48:12](#00:48:12)).

* **Image Quantity and Cohesion** Barrett Shutt asked for a suitable range of photos per project, and SALT STUDIO suggested having at least six images per project ([00:36:47](#00:36:47)). Barrett Shutt confirmed they have more than six photos for many projects, and they will share a PDF presentation to help convey the desired layout ([00:37:43](#00:37:43)). SALT STUDIO explained that they will create one template for the work pages, which will then use a spreadsheet-like structure for adding more pages, allowing for easy movement and arrangement of photos for visual cohesion ([00:38:35](#00:38:35)).

* **Geographic Keywords and Presence** Barrett Shutt raised a question about location-based keywords due to their move from Portland to Kentucky, where they are still working with clients in both areas ([00:43:13](#00:43:13)). SALT STUDIO suggested targeting both Portland and Kentucky in their SEO efforts, as it is advantageous to maintain visibility in Portland where Barrett Shutt still has active client relationships and is working to expand their network in Kentucky ([00:45:27](#00:45:27)).

* **Loading Page Design** Barrett Shutt inquired about the look and feel of the website's loading page. SALT STUDIO confirmed they have not yet focused on this but will address it after the branding is sorted out, aiming for a "super super creative" design ([00:49:04](#00:49:04)).

### Suggested next steps

- [ ] SALT STUDIO will research how to get the best quality of compressed images for the website and start creating a wireframe with the copy, aiming to provide an update by next Friday.  
- [ ] SALT STUDIO will provide an update of logos next week and the next phase of the architecture of the site.  
- [ ] SALT STUDIO will send Barrett Shutt questions regarding the keywords to target for SEO and AEO and will research the best location strategy for the website.

## Playground Checkin \- Transcript

### 00:00:00 {#00:00:00}

**Barrett Shutt:** Can you hear that? I can. Yep.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay, perfect.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** How was your  
**Barrett Shutt:** Ah, it was good.  
**SALT STUDIO:** holidays?  
**Barrett Shutt:** It's been It's been good a lot, but uh with moving and everything, but can't complain. What about yourself?  
**SALT STUDIO:** It was good. It was really good. Yeah. Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Good.  
**SALT STUDIO:** We chilled but it was good.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Love to hear it.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Love to hear it. Trying to get back in the swing of things. Starting the year off.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yes. Exactly. It's been really good. Um trying to launch a little SAS company.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Oh, nice.  
**SALT STUDIO:** But yeah, so it's been busy, but I'm excited. It's going to be a good year.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Awesome.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Love to hear it.  
   
 

### 00:01:45 {#00:01:45}

   
**SALT STUDIO:** Did you like move back to Kentucky for family  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah. Yeah. So, that's originally where I'm from, Louisville, Kentucky. Um,  
**SALT STUDIO:** or  
**Barrett Shutt:** and then I lived out in California for a long time and then Oregon for a long time and now moved back. So, it was just a matter of time when that was going to happen and felt like that time was now. So,  
**SALT STUDIO:** nice  
**Barrett Shutt:** but I'll probably back and forth hopefully quite a bit. I'm actually coming back out to Portland in a few weeks for some work like smaller work campaign stuff that uh I've done with for like hospitality. Um,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
**Barrett Shutt:** so hopefully that and a few other things I can still kind of bounce even though it's not the easiest place to get to from Kentucky. But, um,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay.  
**Barrett Shutt:** yeah,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah,  
**Barrett Shutt:** we'll see.  
**SALT STUDIO:** that's good.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Trying to figure out a lot and figure out how it's all going to play play and  
   
 

### 00:02:34 {#00:02:34}

   
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah, I can imagine.  
**Barrett Shutt:** look in a new in a new area. So,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Totally.  
**Barrett Shutt:** yeah, we're rolling with with the punches,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Totally.  
**Barrett Shutt:** but we're getting there.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Oh, that's good. I'm happy the move went  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** well.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, it was like a it was good that it was like around like the holiday cuz it's a little bit slower work-wise, but at first I was like it felt like we were just coming back for the holidays like we normally do.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Right.  
**Barrett Shutt:** And then it just I think as kind of hit me more and more of like, oh, I'm not going back. So trying to get adjusted,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** but  
**SALT STUDIO:** Oh, that's good. That's awesome. Okay. Well, how are you feeling about um Playground? I have the copy pulled up in front of me and then also your back with the  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah. Okay.  
   
 

### 00:03:24 {#00:03:24}

   
**SALT STUDIO:** logos.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yes. Um, so first off, sorry that things got pushed on the back burner a little bit um with everything, but no, I I'm feeling I'm feeling excited. I'm feeling like I'm I mean,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Awesome.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I'm excited about the project 100% still. Um, and I'm excited to kind of just see it how it evolves. Initially, like I said, there was quite a bit of work and things I like thought I could use and I can't. So, I'm trying to strategically look at what that's going to be when I because unlike maybe some other people you've worked with, it's not like I have this full like everything that like, you know, a big spectrum of a bunch of I thought I kind of had a bigger and more but with just a lot of stuff finding out that I just can't use and put on the website. So, it's not like starting from scratch in by any means, but it's like, you know, it's definitely not like uh I don't know. It's like instead of like going to a This is probably a terrible anal actually.  
   
 

### 00:04:25 {#00:04:25}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** That's a terrible analogy cuz usually if I was like I was like it's like going to a restaurant having a very small menu but like it's catered more local rather than having a big menu. But I'm like I don't like to go to like chain restaurants anyways with a huge menu. So that's like a terrible analogy. But, um, with that, I'm just trying to strategically think through of like the look and the feel, um,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Right.  
**Barrett Shutt:** and just have like the the platform there and ready if things like change in terms of like um, yeah, and we could talk through this. I I know I've been like thinking through a lot, but I'll back up.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Awesome.  
**Barrett Shutt:** The copy uh, was great. I think you really did a great job in in kind of using my verbiage and just your expertise to kind of create the tone of voice. I really didn't have that much like change on there as you you could see. Um simplified a couple things and then there's a couple things I still are I'm missing.  
   
 

### 00:05:21 {#00:05:21}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** I'm like need updated like photo myself and things like that. But I think for the majority of it it's all filled out like to what you need. Um,  
**SALT STUDIO:** No, this looks Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** and okay, so I thought that was Yeah,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I thought that was like really, you know, in a good trajectory there. Um, for sure. Um,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay. Perfect.  
**Barrett Shutt:** so  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah. like as far as um just what you're saying about not having that much like work to put on. I know that's probably just like frustrating because I know you probably have a lot of work, but then it's like the whole legal  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah, it's more like videobased stuff that it it's been a little bit of like I have like photo and then  
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I'm also trying to see like how much because I was thinking through this other day. It's like I have photo and like brands. So like kind of like lifestyle. Then I have like studio and then there's like hospitality and then kind of food within hospitality.  
   
 

### 00:06:27 {#00:06:27}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** But I'm like I don't know like what I like part of me was just like I don't know how to showcase everything that it's not going to be like so many clicks. Like I don't know if you need like 10 hotels that I've shot and then have like I don't know however many x amount of photos within each one like one or it's just like to have like it more the best shots and everything in like one I Does that make sense? I'm trying to because I don't want it to be like oh I got to click on here's hospitality. Okay, I got to scroll all the way down. Click click click scroll scroll scroll and things like that. I'm trying to keep it like user friendly, easy. Does that make sense? Um, I was just thinking through because I have like quite a bit of hospitality, food. I'm like I don't really shoot a lot of food, but I can. It's pretty easy. And a lot of the food's from restaurants at the hotel.  
   
 

### 00:07:25 {#00:07:25}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** So, it's like you're shooting lifestyle, then you're shooting FnB. And then I have like the brand work. um that obviously I kind of want to highlight the most just because it's what I'm more intrigued to to do anyways. Um does that make sense?  
**SALT STUDIO:** So,  
**Barrett Shutt:** cuz  
**SALT STUDIO:** yeah, like your brand work. Would you want to make that like your featured um usually you do like a  
**Barrett Shutt:** I  
**SALT STUDIO:** featured section on like work and we can make that um like bigger and more pro like prominent than the others. You know what I mean? with  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah, I think that will that that's going to evolve too.  
**SALT STUDIO:** that.  
**Barrett Shutt:** But yeah, I think I'm just trying to think through. So, like, sorry if I'm like I just got off a meeting with somebody. I need probably another cup of coffee.  
**SALT STUDIO:** No.  
**Barrett Shutt:** But, um, I'm trying to think through is like, okay, if someone comes to me or I go to them, say there's like a new I'm just going to throw this out there, like a new hotel that pops up and they need like brand work.  
   
 

### 00:08:24

   
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay. What's the easiest way to basically send them to showcase that in a concise way rather than like  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** like is it necessary to have like 10 different hotels I've shot and then click on that and then x amount of photos. Like usually I don't have like a ton ton but like like is that 100% necessary? Is there a better way to do it? just like click on hospitality and then like you know majority of images like arrive like you see it even though it's not like and it's like working with hotels like logos underneath it's not like categorized in like campaign campaign  
**SALT STUDIO:** Right.  
**Barrett Shutt:** campa does that make sense I'm trying to see like what like makes more sense  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah. Um  
**Barrett Shutt:** and stuff on on like my end because it's going to be  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** like three sections really three different styles of photography. It's going to be brand work, it's going to be hospitality, and then probably like food related. And food I don't really care as much much because I'm like I don't do that as frequent, but it's still nice to have um if like a restaurant or something that needs because it's pretty easy and quick to do.  
   
 

### 00:09:43 {#00:09:43}

   
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay. So, what I'm hearing is kind of like a lot of people do even like a multi-  
**Barrett Shutt:** Um,  
**SALT STUDIO:** a multi- uh layer filter, you know what I mean? So, there's like um I'm seeing here like all work, photography, video, branded content, commercial. So, that's kind of like your types of services I would say. And then you could have like um almost just like a  
**Barrett Shutt:** Mhm.  
**SALT STUDIO:** separate tab and I could send you some examples of just like maybe like business and it would just be like a drop down of like hotels and you can add to that over time.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Mhm.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Um what I'm thinking like in a second I want to back up and  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** hear your overall goals but like kind of what I'm thinking through is like SEO and AEO, right? So search engine optimization and answer engine optimization. And so kind of the more that we can like break things up a little  
**Barrett Shutt:** Mhm.  
**SALT STUDIO:** bit um the more that you'll be able to be seen by people um online.  
   
 

### 00:10:56

   
**Barrett Shutt:** Mhm.  
**SALT STUDIO:** So, um, for example, when someone searches on chat GPT, just like, um, you know, photography, I I don't know if you want to aim in Portland or Kentucky now, but photography hotels,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** you know,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Mhm.  
**SALT STUDIO:** it would show yours would show up in chatb. And so, um, I think like the more I know that you want to keep it  
**Barrett Shutt:** Mhm.  
**SALT STUDIO:** simple and we can do that, but at the same time, the more um like kind of like uh specific that we can get into what you do,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Mhm.  
**SALT STUDIO:** I think the more people that we can attract to your website, you know, to get you more clients and and whatnot.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Um, but I would definitely want to hear like your overall goal.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Like what's your goal of this website? Is it to get more clients? Is it to um, you know,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** have like people like view your work? Um, what's your goal?  
   
 

### 00:12:10 {#00:12:10}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah. It's definitely I think it's just a track all in in all in one place that takes my name away and it feels like a cohesive like quality brand that's like coming out. It's like oh you know I own this production company you know small production company because the it's not like you know photon leveles. It's not like shooting like high highend, you know, so it's still like there's thresholds and and stuff in all this media and there's, you know, really running gun small stuff and to really high-end produced commercial stuff and so it's  
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
**Barrett Shutt:** not like the there but it's the idea is just to have it all in, you know, quality work all within one platform and to attract and build clients and just to grow um from there uh with the team and also just growing in terms of like the clients we get to shoot with and things like that. Um because you know the the end goal is yeah obviously  
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
**Barrett Shutt:** to attract more clients and more work. Um, but it is to, you know, shoot for quote unquote bigger brands, more well-known, um, things like that.  
   
 

### 00:13:31 {#00:13:31}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** So, it's definitely like a a a way one I think the initial goal is just to have something that's going to be right there that like when I reach out and, you know, do not cold call, but cold emails or LinkedIn and try and get connected with the right person and explain who I am and like pitch like kind of like pitch services. It's all right there. It's not like pulling like, you know, a drive with videos or like all these different thing,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Totally.  
**Barrett Shutt:** you know, these different things that, you know, I've had to do and pivot. Um, especially because I when I pitch things, it's not just photography services. So, that is the initial goal I think right now.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Um,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay.  
**Barrett Shutt:** if that makes sense.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah, totally. So, I think if that's your goal, the more specific that we can get about your work, the better. Um because you'll just have more visibility.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** So, when you say that it would be beneficial to have like I don't even know like  
   
 

### 00:14:35 {#00:14:35}

   
**SALT STUDIO:** So,  
**Barrett Shutt:** the like like the hotels list and then like the campaign per one.  
**SALT STUDIO:** wow.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay. and do that with the brands and then do that with the um because there  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** are some yeah there are some like even I think the gym class one or some people I know where you kind of click on it's too simplified where there's not much work on there and I'm like I don't really know what I'm looking at if that makes sense.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
**Barrett Shutt:** So it's like um okay if and I and I'm trusting obviously if on that I just didn't know like what was necessary because there's going to be as like I create more work and things get better obviously things will be phased out and updated and things like that or things are going to be showcased you know a little bit higher. Um,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Right.  
**Barrett Shutt:** like I'm doing in the the end of the month I'm doing like a Kindra Scott like small studio shoot for like some of their jewelry,  
   
 

### 00:15:37 {#00:15:37}

   
**SALT STUDIO:** Super cool.  
**Barrett Shutt:** but it's like you know they're obviously it's like women jewelry like but like they're a big well-known brand, right? So, it's like even though it's like a quoteunquote smaller campaign, like just to have the feature of like, you know, it's not going to be a ton of work, but just to have that on there is going to,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I think, help and be like, oh, you know, Kendra Scott or Celsius or things like that, you know, rather than like I just don't want it to feel too much like, oh, I'm shooting for not that I because I kind of weeded out things that I don't really care about, but Um, I don't I I don't know if it's like I think the initial part is I'm going to have a lot more photo wise because I do photo not video really than I'm going to have videos. So, it's going to feel more photoheavy.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I feel like starting out until I incorporate, you know, this year as I can get as things are run through Playground, then I'll have like full rights to showcase videos if that makes sense.  
   
 

### 00:16:43 {#00:16:43}

   
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** So, that's what there's a lot of work video wise that I haven't been I won't be able to use, which is really dumb,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay.  
**Barrett Shutt:** but long story short, whatever. Um, that I it might feel like a little bit more like, oh, it's just like a photography stuff or Yeah, cuz Yeah, there's definitely a lot more photo than there are video.  
**SALT STUDIO:** I think yeah, I think that that's completely fine. I think that people they see quality work and are understanding if you're growing like in an area, you know.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah. Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah. I think something is better is always better than nothing too,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** you know.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** And so,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Because the goal is to do more like have more video and once like even like this Kinder Scott one,  
**SALT STUDIO:** right.  
**Barrett Shutt:** it's all streamlined through, you know, it's not even still work. I might do some still with it to add on, but it's just video and so it's just like I'll be able to showcase that, you know.  
   
 

### 00:17:45

   
**Barrett Shutt:** Um, but for the most part, it's going to be like a little bit more by a little bit a lot more photoheavy to begin with. Obviously, it's really like the foundations.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I'm just cutting it up and then it's going to tweak and mold and grow from there. Um,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** but if you think it's better to kind of have everything listed out, then that's that's that's great. I trust whatever you think is best cuz you've seen a lot on your end of what works well and what doesn't work as  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah,  
**Barrett Shutt:** well.  
**SALT STUDIO:** for me it's more just about like coming back to your goal of attracting clients and just the more visibility that we can get out there,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** the better.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Um, and so that's that's kind of what I'm thinking. But obviously whatever wherever you want to land is what we'll  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I know. I I think Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** do.  
   
 

### 00:18:41 {#00:18:41}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** I I mean I'm right now I'm kind of going through content like even there's some old content where I've had to like go back. I like I don't even have the raw file anymore to because they're all too big. Um, which with web and I guess the previous designer did I don't know like I know load like there are some things I'm lo like like load very slow. So, I get that everything needs to be under like 500, but I'm like I'm trying to like go back there and compress these images, these JPEG images without losing too much quality,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** but are good enough for web that load fast that you wouldn't know,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Wait.  
**Barrett Shutt:** you know, unless you like zoom all the way in that it loses some,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Totally.  
**Barrett Shutt:** you know, quality and and but so it's  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah. Yeah. I'll do a little research too of how we can get the best quality of  
**Barrett Shutt:** like, yeah,  
**SALT STUDIO:** that.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I was trying to do because I was like I was trying to do some research And like the way that from my understanding with some of that just having JPEGs, not the raw files anymore cuz then I have to like I'm probably I'm this is another goal of mine.  
   
 

### 00:19:47 {#00:19:47}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** I need to be way more organized and this is going to allow me to be way more organized because it's not just me. It's going to be running through things. But I'm like the least organized creative person. I swear. Like sometimes I'm like how do I even get stuff done? Like how do I know where things are? because like everything's just all over the place. Um, but so I've had to like kind of go through Lightroom, import them back in, go through the dimensions on the exports, the file dimensions and and just kind of like change. And for my look, like, you know, everything's between like maybe like 200 to 500, they, you know, unless I'm zooming in really like they definitely lose some detail for sure. They're not as like, you know, but I don't think you'd ever know on like a web or mobile or things like  
**SALT STUDIO:** No,  
**Barrett Shutt:** that.  
**SALT STUDIO:** you don't notice.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah. So,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah,  
**Barrett Shutt:** I'm like it's more about just I guess the importance of it things running smooth and speed.  
   
 

### 00:20:45

   
**SALT STUDIO:** right. Totally.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** So,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** that's what I've had to do for a lot which has taken me a really long time but it's fine. I'm like and I think that's the best way to do it.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yes.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Uh because it wasn't giving me like the web like that one. I don't know with my Lightroom, but I have Lightroom Classic and it's all up to date. So,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah, JPEGs will work just fine.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I'm like okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah, no worries at all. Yeah. Mhm. Um,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** how I just wanted to connect too about um actually while we're talking about copy, how did you feel kind of like about the flow of how everything kind of works together? Do you like like for example on the home  
**Barrett Shutt:** Let me pull up it again just so I um Okay. So, are you talking about like the homepage about contact work and then  
**SALT STUDIO:** Uh yeah.  
   
 

### 00:21:55 {#00:21:55}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** like just like how the or are you talking about the flow of  
**SALT STUDIO:** So on the homepage, um just how kind of like each section like the  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** order and the  
**Barrett Shutt:** I think Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** flow.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I mean it like I don't know how how you're planning are you planning on putting the like I don't know how this is going to resonate visually on like a site but from just looking at the flow of everything it looks like it looks great to me um it  
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay. Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** does that so I don't know what is going to like translate onto like the web like on but I mean these are things where like I I trust like all the  
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
**Barrett Shutt:** necessary copy and content is there that I like to highlight and just from looking like this I I think it's straightforward and is detailed and flows nice.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Um,  
**SALT STUDIO:** perfect.  
**Barrett Shutt:** like the featured client se for instance, like the featured client section, would that just be kind of like rotating at the bottom?  
   
 

### 00:23:01 {#00:23:01}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** You know how sites do or like like  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah, exactly. You know, like kind of those like moving um  
**Barrett Shutt:** um  
**SALT STUDIO:** uh Sorry, the word is just escaping me. Um you know, like the logos on the website that just kind of like move across the page horizontally. Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** So yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** So it's just kind of like  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah. Which I Yeah. Which is great.  
**SALT STUDIO:** that.  
**Barrett Shutt:** And I figured so um I think Yeah. I think on that end then for sure I think everything kind of flows flows really nice.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Awesome.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Um and it yeah it looks  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** um  
**SALT STUDIO:** Kind of like as I create it and see it visually, I might like switch some things around.  
**Barrett Shutt:** for sure and I'm going to lean into your expertise on that visually and I I'm just going to trust you on that. I I don't think I'm going to be super super picky in terms of that.  
   
 

### 00:23:54 {#00:23:54}

   
**SALT STUDIO:** Awesome.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Like I'm If you're like doing something and you're like actually I think this is going to look better and play more effectively or efficiently, you know, moving it this then you do your thing. It's your your playground too. No pun  
**SALT STUDIO:** Cool. Okay. Perfect.  
**Barrett Shutt:** intended.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Um, so with with the copy and just getting that into a wireframe, um, I will start that process next week and then hopefully  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** get you an update like by maybe Friday or so.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay. Great.  
**SALT STUDIO:** You can kind of see it.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Um and then uh the designer he is working on those second revisions of logos as well.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay. Yeah. So, with that,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Um  
**Barrett Shutt:** it might be a little bit easier to talk with that. I like the direction. I think some of them were a little too playful for my liking. Um or a little bit too much.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
   
 

### 00:25:06

   
**Barrett Shutt:** So like a little bit less playful simplified version um that I was kind of just playing around  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yes.  
**Barrett Shutt:** with. Um, in terms of like, uh, I would have to go back, but like the copy on I think the first one in the logo. I know I know it was like trying to go with like the like I think it's like the thing that has like the spring and you kind of just rock back and forth on it. I forget what those are called, but I was like that idea could be cool. Maybe if it's just like a teeter totter play a little bit that's a little bit less playful, abstract, a little bit I don't know. Does that make sense? So, I thought like the idea there is really cool, but it's a little playful.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yes, I agree  
**Barrett Shutt:** Is that does that does that does that makes which I'm not like bashing.  
**SALT STUDIO:** totally.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I like the direction. I was just trying to like critique because I know I haven't done the best job in like taking things in here and  
   
 

### 00:26:00

   
**SALT STUDIO:** No, no,  
**Barrett Shutt:** giving  
**SALT STUDIO:** you're you have to we have to land where you like love it.  
**Barrett Shutt:** room.  
**SALT STUDIO:** So be super critical at this part because the logo you have to Sorry, I'm like literally just trying to share the screen so that we can see them here. Um, sorry. Give me one  
**Barrett Shutt:** No, you're  
**SALT STUDIO:** second.  
**Barrett Shutt:** good.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay, I'm going to have to quit and reopen. So, I I have it pulled here so I can see it. Um but yeah,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** so kind of what I conveyed to him is that generally except for how like playful even like the font it feel I remember you saying it feels kind of like young. Um,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Mhm.  
**SALT STUDIO:** so we are going to And I feel like even the the rounded like edges even on this um Oh,  
**Barrett Shutt:** I can pull it up, too. Let me pull it up so we can both uh look at it.  
**SALT STUDIO:** perfect.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Um that way I can kind of track with you a little bit better.  
   
 

### 00:27:22 {#00:27:22}

   
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah, that would be great.  
**Barrett Shutt:** At  
**SALT STUDIO:** Thanks.  
**Barrett Shutt:** least I can find it.  
**SALT STUDIO:** I think it's on our texts.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Oh, you're right. I was like looking at email. Let me go back. Let me go back through here. Um  
**SALT STUDIO:** here. I'll give it you can see  
**Barrett Shutt:** yeah. Okay. I'm just going to pull them all pull them all  
**SALT STUDIO:** it.  
**Barrett Shutt:** up. Yeah. So, like the first one I thought like the the text was a little bit young.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Um, which I think I honestly like the the text if you go to the third  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** one. Um, the the font I think of just like I get where like so this was I get kind of the idea with like the logo. I think it was a little too much, like too in your face. A little bit more subtle. Um, but I like I liked on this one.  
   
 

### 00:28:49 {#00:28:49}

   
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I like I think I like the text play more where it says like playground with the then studios underneath. Um, and just like the font more on that one.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** um that kind of style. I don't know how we're going to land on that specific but that looks a little bit more I don't know mature but like a little less cuz ours like playground the idea is a little playful but I don't want it to come off too playful if that makes sense. Um cuz it's still a brand. It's still like, you know,  
**SALT STUDIO:** I feel like you kind of nailed it um with the bandit  
**Barrett Shutt:** uh  
**SALT STUDIO:** one.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I love the Bandit  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah. So like cuz even um you know from the second  
**Barrett Shutt:** branding.  
**SALT STUDIO:** uh like concept the the P that's like the slide that you have it's even kind of like similarish to like the curvy thing that Bandit has. And so like kind of they put this like very like straightforward font with like an icon  
   
 

### 00:29:54

   
**Barrett Shutt:** Mhm.  
**SALT STUDIO:** that has that like curve play to it. Um,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Mhm.  
**SALT STUDIO:** and I remember you saying how you do want to you're leaning towards sticking with the that original icon.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah, I think I mean I think here's where I'm landing  
**SALT STUDIO:** Correct.  
**Barrett Shutt:** and something around the original icon with the P. I think the P idea can be cool or if there's a way cuz I I don't I didn't dislike the symbol on the first one. I thought like it reminded me kind of like a dog. But if there's a way to do something abstract with maybe a teeter totter um could be kind of cool. I don't know how that would play um 100%. But something where it's like a symbol where it doesn't look it's hard to put into words where it doesn't look like  
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay.  
**Barrett Shutt:** too rounded edge or too clip arty, but like something that's kind of unique and abstract. Even like the bandit like I'm pull up bandit again. Obviously, it's like, do I know it's a B?  
   
 

### 00:31:17 {#00:31:17}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** Probably next to Bandit, but it's a little bit, you know, a little bit has like I don't know if this is the right, it's a little bit more symbolized kind of like the initial things that I I sense. um kind of like a little bit more abstract,  
**SALT STUDIO:** like a little bit more abstract.  
**Barrett Shutt:** a little bit more like symbol wide like looking um if  
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
**Barrett Shutt:** and kind of similar to I don't know I'd have to pull back up but some of like those fonts I sent from the um like you can you know It's pretty I don't know it. Yeah, I I'm like chewing over my words here,  
**SALT STUDIO:** No feel like we have a solid like place  
**Barrett Shutt:** but  
**SALT STUDIO:** to Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** okay. Yeah, a little bit a little bit more like I guess abstract  
**SALT STUDIO:** Um,  
**Barrett Shutt:** simplified. Um because I think it'll play well with the playground just like and I know I sent you that. Um which this is really bad.  
**SALT STUDIO:** the drawings  
   
 

### 00:32:30 {#00:32:30}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** Um the which one?  
**SALT STUDIO:** one is it  
**Barrett Shutt:** Sorry. I'mma see the one this the one in our text of  
**SALT STUDIO:** a Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** this which I'm like that font or something like that. And I kind of liked like the studios under smaller and I kind of liked how it was spaced out. Um kind of cool to mix it up. I don't know. Those are just initial thoughts as I was like looking at it. Had my wife look at it. Had my my brother is pretty creatively too. Um just get second opinions and things. And I think they were all kind of leading more towards what we were talking about too of  
**SALT STUDIO:** Right.  
**Barrett Shutt:** like the look and the feel.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah. And I'm also noticing like with the even like the all of the examples kind of that you sent um as feedback, it's like really like linear and not um like curved uh like sort of edges. Is that what you're wanting as well for website?  
   
 

### 00:33:31

   
**SALT STUDIO:** like leaning more like straight edges, not really like um like the uh you know uh sorry you know um on like the  
**Barrett Shutt:** No, you're good.  
**SALT STUDIO:** playground concepts that we have and then  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah. Let me pull that  
**SALT STUDIO:** like like the cards are like  
**Barrett Shutt:** up.  
**SALT STUDIO:** rounded  
**Barrett Shutt:** Um, wait. I think I just not in the right uh sorry repeat that one more time. The the  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah. So, you see how um for example like that black card how it has the  
**Barrett Shutt:** cards  
**SALT STUDIO:** edges but they're like kind of like rounded. So, it's not like a straight up square. It's like  
**Barrett Shutt:** where I'm I think I'm so sorry. I feel I'm think I'm totally lost here. Where what are you looking at?  
**SALT STUDIO:** so um the playground like concepts, you know, the one that looks kind of like a dog.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** I'm just talking about kind of the backgrounds that they're  
   
 

### 00:34:43 {#00:34:43}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** Sorry.  
**SALT STUDIO:** on.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Oh, the backgrounds. Are you talking just like how they curved on the  
**SALT STUDIO:** Like Yes.  
**Barrett Shutt:** edges?  
**SALT STUDIO:** So,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Oh.  
**SALT STUDIO:** it I'm just talking about for like the website. Um, because I noticed a lot of the examples that you sent, it's like a lot more like straight edges, kind of like a linear style.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Gotcha. To be honest,  
**SALT STUDIO:** That's  
**Barrett Shutt:** I I that's a good uh I I didn't even really I wasn't even really looking or noticing like that as much. Um but I guess if it's like the info that I've sent that's probably and it's like a little bit more straight cut, then maybe I should just we should lean towards that. Um but I didn't even like notice that or really pay attention to that when I was going through this.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Um yeah, but I think yeah,  
**SALT STUDIO:** gotcha.  
**Barrett Shutt:** if the things have kind of sit a little bit more sharp and linear, then maybe we lean into that because  
   
 

### 00:35:44 {#00:35:44}

   
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay, cool.  
**Barrett Shutt:** um yeah, sorry. Sorry, I was not tracking for a  
**SALT STUDIO:** You're good. I was trying to explain it, but it's so tough when I can't share my screen.  
**Barrett Shutt:** second.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Um, okay. So, um, next week you'll have an update of logos. The designer and I are kind of like going back and forth, um, with that and I just want to show you something that's that's solid.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** So, I'll just wait until till next week to do that.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay, cool.  
**SALT STUDIO:** And then um as well as kind of like the next phase of the architecture of the site and all of that.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Do you have any  
**Barrett Shutt:** Um,  
**SALT STUDIO:** questions?  
**Barrett Shutt:** not Oh, I guess so. I'm in the process of and it's taken me because I kind of have to do it for a lot of the campaigns to to doing this export going in and making these things smaller, these images smaller. Um, how many do you think is like necessary?  
   
 

### 00:36:47 {#00:36:47}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** Because like obviously I I probably need to order them from like show this one first. Um how many you think like I don't know like I have this brand or this hotel you click on it like visually is it going to like be like scroll linear or horizontal or I don't even know. I'm stupid. Like when you scroll down is it going to be like photo photo like kind of stacked?  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Um,  
**SALT STUDIO:** probably some will be like bigger than others.  
**Barrett Shutt:** yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** So,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** um  
**Barrett Shutt:** Like how I guess how many like like it's like a good range of like photos per where it's  
**SALT STUDIO:** Oh,  
**Barrett Shutt:** not like you know I'm scrolling it's like I don't need all all  
**SALT STUDIO:** yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** this, you  
**SALT STUDIO:** I would say like what would be awesome to have is like at least maybe six  
**Barrett Shutt:** know.  
**SALT STUDIO:** photos project.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay. Yeah. Okay. Well, I have way more. That's That's good cuz I have way more than that on.  
   
 

### 00:37:43 {#00:37:43}

   
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay, perfect. Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Um,  
**SALT STUDIO:** And  
**Barrett Shutt:** like some of them have a lot more and maybe I don't know if it's more beneficial for me to try  
**SALT STUDIO:** those  
**Barrett Shutt:** and go or like cuz some of them you'll see where it's like for instance Cadence there's like a theme there's a color scheme like you you'll see on visually when you look at the photos but there's like  
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
**Barrett Shutt:** uh some like brown tones that like would play well then it transitions into like a because I'm shooting it from like d not dawn to dusk but like at night where it turns into like the tone is more blue. And so I I don't know if I ever sent you the PDF. I'll send you a PDF kind of like the format that I like I sent. It's just like a presentation type that you'll you'll you'll understand once you see the content. Um shoot, where was I going with that? Oh my gosh.  
**SALT STUDIO:** layout of the  
**Barrett Shutt:** Um yeah, so I don't know if it's beneficial because like I'll have I don't know.  
   
 

### 00:38:35 {#00:38:35}

   
**SALT STUDIO:** page.  
**Barrett Shutt:** It takes a long time to like go through and try and like categorize. I'd be like here here I can like be like here's the first couple but maybe is there any way on your end if you even if it's like you know I'm giving you 20 images but we're only taking like 10 or 15 or whatever it is. I don't care if on all of them but like then you can kind of categorize like you'll be able to see like okay this one compliments this one or this one compliments this one and kind of like have it so it's like cohesive when you go down. Does that make sense? Rather than like  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah. Right. So, um how just so you can understand like how those pages work for the work, we'll make one template of the page and then what happens is it's kind of  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay. Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** like a spreadsheet. So, as you add rows to a spreadsheet, it just makes more pages.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
   
 

### 00:39:32

   
**Barrett Shutt:** So,  
**SALT STUDIO:** And so,  
**Barrett Shutt:** is it pretty easy just to like take it and then move and Okay,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Totally.  
**Barrett Shutt:** cool.  
**SALT STUDIO:** And so, um, we can kind of nail down like one to make sure you like the layout of how everything looks.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** And then, uh, after we do that,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** um, I feel like the rest will just kind of like go super quick.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** And even if you wanted to have a little bit more like control of like, you know, testing where the pictures go and all of that, I can give you some access to be able to do that if you want.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Um,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay. Cool.  
**SALT STUDIO:** whatever you prefer. Or I can I can do it myself.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Whatever you prefer.  
**Barrett Shutt:** So, you would need at least like because I mean I have six images. I think there's like one campaign I did that was like I probably have just right at six or seven.  
   
 

### 00:40:18

   
**Barrett Shutt:** But you would say anywhere between like six to like what would be like a max like you would  
**SALT STUDIO:** Honestly,  
**Barrett Shutt:** say.  
**SALT STUDIO:** that's up to you. Um,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** I could what I'll do is I'll just probably look for some examples of what other  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** studios are doing and then um even the examples that you sent  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** me and then we can kind of count and see from there.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay. Cuz what I'm trying to do right now is at least like it is and I'll sh I can honestly go ahead and start sharing it with you,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Um,  
**Barrett Shutt:** but just a drive that kind of like has brand a folder brands has all the brands, you know, and it's all within each brand. Hospitality, hotels, boom, food. I think how I gonna kind of crack categorize it. Um, and then within there will have like all the content, but like I mean some of the hotels I just shot, I think initially I have like 30 to 40 images.  
   
 

### 00:41:13

   
**Barrett Shutt:** I'm like I don't know if I need all that. So I'm like and some of them are kind of similar. So I might have to like go in there and refine be like actually I don't need I'm just trying to get it like a good start and not trying to be too picky right now. Just trying to get everything under, you know, the the right file size and then in one place so you so we can kind be able to see some of  
**SALT STUDIO:** Right. And also what I would kind of be thinking through as well is just like your favorite photos of  
**Barrett Shutt:** it.  
**SALT STUDIO:** all time like throughout the projects to kind of use within your your website as well. Um just to maybe put duplicate those and put them in another  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** folder just so that we can have we can have those  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** easy. Um, but yeah,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** if you want to get uh I think it's amazing that you're getting all the photos in the in the sizing and just putting those into folders, that's that's perfect.  
   
 

### 00:42:09

   
**SALT STUDIO:** Um, but just so that you're not wasting time too to just think of like we'll nail down that one work template first to see how many  
**Barrett Shutt:** Mhm.  
**SALT STUDIO:** pictures we would need from each  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay. Yeah, cuz I mean with this right now, it's pretty easy just to like select the ones I like and like not be too picky initially and just reexporting them into the f into the folder.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Mhm.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Um so it's kind of just having and then I can kind of see from there like what we decide after like the template or whatnot.  
**SALT STUDIO:** What?  
**Barrett Shutt:** Um what? Because yeah, there are some that I like more that I'd like to like showcase, but then yeah, it's just like I don't know. I see these photos so much or I'm like sometimes it's nice to have someone else's eyes on them because I start seeing seeing uh seeing them differently. But um okay, that all sounds good. That all sounds good. So, I'm going to continue to work on that because it's honestly it's pretty tedious and so it does take time and I'm trying to get a head start.  
   
 

### 00:43:13 {#00:43:13}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** So, like once you know the foundation or whatever is ready and the plug and play when it comes to some of the content  
**SALT STUDIO:** Awesome.  
**Barrett Shutt:** that will already be kind of like you know ready to go or like at least like there. So,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Cool.  
**Barrett Shutt:** sweet.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay, that's all that I had to kind of go over. Oh, actually, I do have one more thing. Um,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yep.  
**SALT STUDIO:** I will probably like send over a few questions to you.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** um just regarding what kind of keywords that you want to target um for SEO and AEO.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** So for example like you know Portland, Kentucky, you know all sort of  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah. Okay. Well, okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** things  
**Barrett Shutt:** That's actually um it brought that's actually a good point because right now like I'm I think I might have said on like the copy or texted. I don't know. But since I've like kind of like moved, you know, I have not quote unquote but I have moved.  
   
 

### 00:44:16

   
**Barrett Shutt:** Uh some clients don't know that and they don't really care. But um for feasibility and easy, I kind of wanted until I got like a better system of how this is all going to play out with like client uh port organ clients versus like other clients like uh I kind of not wanted to be anonymous, but I kind of did want to be like like say I'm like I'm in my bio I'm I live in Kentucky or like we're based out of Kentucky because I don't know if Does that make sense? Like I'm trying to have like a with some of these clients have like a a better um what am I trying to say? A better system because there are some things where it is advantageous that I am located in Portland and not like they don't won't ever know that I don't live there anymore. But I don't want things to be like I want the transition to kind of like figure some some of that with a with the client first. So,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I didn't know if that really matters when it comes to like bio location based out of like obviously I'm not I'm kind of based in Kentucky and Portland now because it's like I still work with a lot of people in Portland and here.  
   
 

### 00:45:27 {#00:45:27}

   
**Barrett Shutt:** Does that make sense? I'm trying to maybe that's not even relevant um at the moment,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah. So,  
**Barrett Shutt:** but  
**SALT STUDIO:** the only thing that would affect is if someone Googled Portland photography, you know what I mean? You just wouldn't.  
**Barrett Shutt:** yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** So, um,  
**Barrett Shutt:** But is it like stupid? I'm like I'm there so much like I could like you  
**SALT STUDIO:** yeah, that I think you should honestly do both to be  
**Barrett Shutt:** know. Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** real.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Like you know I have connections too and I'm like I'm literally going back out there for a shoot that you know the hotel doesn't even know I I moved. So it's like it might be advantageous to do both.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I don't know. We can figure out that later.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Okay. So,  
**Barrett Shutt:** That's  
**SALT STUDIO:** I'll I'll kind of send something your way at uh some point next  
**Barrett Shutt:** okay.  
**SALT STUDIO:** week. Um but yeah,  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay.  
   
 

### 00:46:22

   
**SALT STUDIO:** I might do some kind of research of my own too to see that. Um but we'll just do whatever is best for you. But just to kind of see how that would work and if there's like something else we could do instead of a location, if that makes sense.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Yeah, because that is well that is another goal too is to try and get like a bigger network where I am because it is nice especially when it's like hospitality or things like because I travel for brand shoots quite a bit and because those are usually higher budgets and you know there's room it's like I'm on location at different parts like but like some of the hospitality stuff or like trying to expand that which is like honestly it's a little bit easier low m lower maintenance Uh, I would like to like, you know, try and expand that on a digital presence in Kentucky. Um, because yeah, it it is nice to have some local clients just like I did out in Oregon here just to be able to, you know, do things more frequently.  
   
 

### 00:47:22

   
**Barrett Shutt:** And then like the brand stuff is usually like I'm, you know, I'm I'm I'm usually going to locations for it outside.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Right. Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** So like where I'm based out of doesn't really matter as much. So but  
**SALT STUDIO:** Got Okay,  
**Barrett Shutt:** yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** perfect.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Well,  
**SALT STUDIO:** All right, cool.  
**Barrett Shutt:** sweet.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Did you have any more Oops. Any more questions at  
**Barrett Shutt:** I don't think so. No, that was that was good. Um yeah,  
**SALT STUDIO:** all?  
**Barrett Shutt:** I don't think so. But if anything comes on your end where you need, let me know and vice versa. Um, but I'm excited to see kind of the some of that stuff coming in next week. So, you said by uh Friday you um send me an email.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Okay, perfect.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**SALT STUDIO:** for  
**Barrett Shutt:** I'm excited to get it up where I can like start like reaching out again because that's been not on pot like a little bit just because I'm like waiting to have everything a little bit more solidified.  
**SALT STUDIO:** yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** So it'll be good especially the start of the year and reaching out to companies and just to have a better you know digital presence which will be nice.  
**SALT STUDIO:** And I I feel like um even though we've been delayed,  
**Barrett Shutt:** So  
**SALT STUDIO:** uh our our deadline was supposed to be end of January, right?  
**Barrett Shutt:** I think it was somewhere around there which I'm like I'm assuming that is going to be pushed back just because I haven't been as proactive on my end.  
**SALT STUDIO:** No,  
**Barrett Shutt:** I can't off the top of my head.  
**SALT STUDIO:** honestly.  
**Barrett Shutt:** I don't know like like how Yeah, maybe realistically like how long I mean just from us chatting and and things like what what would be a  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** timeline? Not like I'm in a huge huge rush, but  
   
 

### 00:49:04 {#00:49:04}

   
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah, I think honestly these past months I've learned how to use some  
**Barrett Shutt:** um  
**SALT STUDIO:** new AI tools to my favor.  
**Barrett Shutt:** Oh,  
**SALT STUDIO:** So like we'll be able to like meet that deadline  
**Barrett Shutt:** nice. Okay, cool.

**Barrett Shutt:** Mhm.  
**SALT STUDIO:** but I'm going to get after we get probably like the branding sorted out,

**Barrett Shutt:** Mhm. Yeah.  
**SALT STUDIO:** Does that sound  
**Barrett Shutt:** No. Yeah,  
**SALT STUDIO:** okay?  
**Barrett Shutt:** totally. Like it's I was just curious because I know I sent you that one from my buddy when Rabbit House is his agency and  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** obviously I don't want things to like look identical to that by any means, but I was like, "Oh, that's like a clever way like loading page type." I forget the words you use  
**SALT STUDIO:** Right.  
**Barrett Shutt:** for that. Um, but I was I was just curious. Yeah,  
**SALT STUDIO:** Yeah.  
**Barrett Shutt:** but totally totally
