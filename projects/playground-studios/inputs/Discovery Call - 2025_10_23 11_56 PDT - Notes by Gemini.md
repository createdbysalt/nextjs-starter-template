### Details

* **Introduction and Project Overview** Barrett Shutt opened the meeting by explaining their connection to Chris and their background as a photographer who has freelanced for brands for five years. They described their intention to transition from freelance work to establishing a production studio agency called Playground Studios, which would offer photo and video services to companies and brands. Barrett Shutt shared that a previous web developer for this project became unavailable, leading them to seek new assistance for site development ([00:00:59](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.8guo6wwcbcm7)) ([00:03:15](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.fga3kv2wuz1d)).

* **Website Vision and Aesthetic Preferences** Barrett Shutt detailed their vision for Playground Studios' website, emphasizing the need for an elevated and professional digital presence beyond their personal name ([00:04:22](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.wvwverduiez6)). They expressed a preference for an "abstract creative" style over a standard website design, aiming to mix creativity with production aesthetics ([00:05:33](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.f8ue8sh1gqc6)). Barrett Shutt shared design inspiration from sites like DBT, highlighting aspects such as minimal auto-populating content, clean lettering, movement, and subtle embedded design elements ([00:07:52](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.jrphmqb2bhb6)). They also appreciated the bold typography and movement of the logo on Courtney White's Gym Class site, favoring minimal clicks and directness ([00:10:00](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.9wgvwpfq55i1)).

* **Branding and Logo Concepts** Barrett Shutt shared that the logo concept for Playground Studios is a slide in the form of a "P," reflecting their desire for an abstract and creative feel ([00:05:33](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.f8ue8sh1gqc6)) ([00:11:08](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.9c5f27lyquoh)). They explained that the name "Playground Studios" originated from personal reflection on playgrounds as places of inspiration and imagination, aiming to convey a playful yet professional approach to bringing clients' ideas to fruition ([00:14:05](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.479dmadhz643)). SALT STUDIO expressed enthusiasm for the name, appreciating its creativity and the "wonder" aspect it conveys ([00:15:13](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.5cfll7ac64lf)).

* **Branding and Website Development Scope** SALT STUDIO confirmed their studio, Salt Studio, is undergoing its own rebranding and helps brands define their identity, expressing interest in Barrett Shutt's project ([00:15:13](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.5cfll7ac64lf)). Barrett Shutt clarified that while the project's idea and vision are strong, they are still refining the branding and logo, indicating openness to further critique and solidification ([00:17:07](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.xbq3k2omxc0x)). SALT STUDIO suggested they could help solidify the branding, including colors, fonts, and ensuring the logo works cohesively with other elements ([00:18:07](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.bj4vphfp8sa7)).

* **Website Functionality and Content** Barrett Shutt confirmed the website should showcase their capabilities, services, and a portfolio ([00:19:14](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.q0l68lbbadhr)). When asked about a "case study" format, Barrett Shutt initially leaned towards a simpler "showcase" of work rather than in-depth process breakdowns, as their current projects are smaller scale compared to larger productions like Photon's ([00:20:31](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.fxpvbhhyg9cx)) ([00:22:46](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.voftxh6ebyfb)). SALT STUDIO explained that incorporating "copy" (text content) on the page is beneficial for SEO purposes, even if showcasing videos, which Barrett Shutt acknowledged ([00:23:53](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.c0b2sux2q3tx)).

* **Proposal and Timeline Discussion** Barrett Shutt expressed interest in SALT STUDIO preparing a proposal based on the shared documentation to help articulate the desired style and avoid a "too standard" website design ([00:24:43](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.eyk0m3jzo8iv)). Regarding the timeline, Barrett Shutt aimed for a launch around early 2026 but deferred to SALT STUDIO's expertise on feasibility ([00:26:49](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.e0tn02dbhvz8)). SALT STUDIO estimated a production time of two to three months, indicating the early 2026 goal might be possible after reviewing the documentation ([00:27:53](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.epva4lgo34ri)).

* **Budget and Project Management** Barrett Shutt discussed budget expectations, noting previous quotes ranging from $2,000 to $15,000, and stated that $15,000 was currently beyond their budget ([00:28:50](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.br0rdsslhyu8)). They expressed openness to a proposal to understand SALT STUDIO's pricing structure, whether it's hourly or a flat rate ([00:29:52](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.5zomb77ovnxq)). For website management post-development, Barrett Shutt preferred to manage it themselves for routine updates like adding imagery or video, rather than relying on frequent external help for major design changes ([00:31:00](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.7xglmicnn22l)) ([00:33:08](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.1jp5gpgl4yx5)). SALT STUDIO confirmed they could set up the website in Webflow to allow Barrett Shutt and their team to easily add projects through a form, with major design changes requiring their assistance ([00:31:55](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.l7lol28skxrq)).

* **Background and Next Steps** SALT STUDIO shared their background in web development and their recent transition to full-time work with Salt Studio after being in ministry ([00:36:50](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.8t1rm1gge2ba)). Barrett Shutt and SALT STUDIO confirmed the positive connection made through Chris ([00:37:43](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.x7e4jc4fbfz6)). SALT STUDIO concluded by stating they would follow up with Barrett Shutt next week to present a deck outlining possibilities for the project ([00:37:43](?tab=t.h5xprzzi6iw1#heading=h.x7e4jc4fbfz6)).
