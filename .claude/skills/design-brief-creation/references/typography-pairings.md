# Typography Pairings

## Principles of Pairing

### Rule 1: Contrast or Match
Either pair fonts that are **clearly different** (serif + sans) or use **the same family** (weights/styles). Avoid fonts that are similar but not the same—they'll look like a mistake.

### Rule 2: One Display, One Workhorse
If using two fonts: one for headlines (can be distinctive) and one for body (must be highly readable).

### Rule 3: Shared Characteristics
Good pairings often share: x-height, character width, or historical era—even when they contrast in category (serif vs sans).
