## Color Proportion Guidelines

### The 60-30-10 Rule

```
60% — Dominant (Background, surfaces)
30% — Secondary (Text, headings, UI elements)
10% — Accent (CTAs, highlights, key actions)
```

### Applied Example

```
Homepage for a SaaS product:

60% - White/light gray backgrounds
30% - Dark text, cards, navigation
10% - Blue CTAs, highlights, icons
```

### When to Break the Rule

- **Landing pages:** Can use more accent color for impact
- **Dark mode:** Inverse the ratio
- **Brand-heavy pages:** More primary color acceptable
- **Content pages:** Less accent, more neutrals
