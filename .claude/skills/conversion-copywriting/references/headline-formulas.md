2. One **curiosity-focused** headline
3. One **proof-focused** headline

### Testing Priority

Test headlines that differ in:
1. **Approach** (benefit vs curiosity vs proof)
2. **Specificity** (vague vs specific numbers)
3. **Length** (short punchy vs longer explanatory)

### Red Flags to Avoid

- ❌ Headlines that could apply to any competitor
- ❌ Headlines with no clear benefit
- ❌ Headlines that require context to understand
- ❌ Headlines that are clever but unclear
- ❌ Headlines that don't match the page content
