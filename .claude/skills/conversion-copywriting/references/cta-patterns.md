# CTA Copy Patterns

## How to Use This Reference

The CTA is where conversion happens or doesn't. Use these patterns to write CTAs that match the commitment level, psychological driver, and page context. Always pair button text with supporting copy to reduce friction.

## The CTA Formula

```
[ACTION VERB] + [OWNERSHIP] + [VALUE/OUTCOME]

Example:
"Start" + "My" + "Free Trial"
= "Start My Free Trial"
```

### Supporting Text Formula

```
[RISK REDUCER] + [TIMEFRAME/EASE]

Example:
"No credit card required" + "Takes 30 seconds"
= "No credit card required. Takes 30 seconds."
```

## CTAs by Page Type

### Homepage

**Primary:** Get Started / Start Free Trial / See Plans
**Secondary:** See How It Works / Watch Demo / Learn More

```
Example combo:
[Primary] "Start Your Free Trial"
[Secondary] "Or watch a 2-minute demo →"
Supporting: "No credit card required. Cancel anytime."
```

### Product/Service Page

**Primary:** Buy Now / Get Started / Book Demo

[Primary] "Add to My Routine"
Supporting: "Free shipping. 30-day returns."
[Secondary] "Find your perfect products →"
```

### Pricing Page

```
Example:
Starter: "Start Free"
Pro: "Start Pro Trial" ← highlight
Enterprise: "Talk to Sales"
Supporting: "All plans include free migration. No hidden fees."
```

### Landing Page (Ads)

**Single CTA:** One action, repeated throughout

       who get our weekly insights."
```

## First Person vs Second Person

### First Person ("My")

Research shows first-person often converts better:

```
✓ "Start My Free Trial"
✓ "Get My Custom Report"
✓ "Create My Account"
```

**Why:** Creates sense of ownership before purchase.

### Second Person ("Your")

Still effective, especially for benefit framing:

```
✓ "Start Your Journey"
✓ "Get Your Results"
✓ "Build Your Future"
```

**Why:** Speaks directly to the reader.

### Recommendation

Test both. When in doubt, default to first person for transactional CTAs.

---

## CTA Placement Rules

### Above the Fold
Always have primary CTA visible without scrolling.

### After Value Established
Add CTA after explaining a benefit or showing proof.

### After Objection Handled
Add CTA after FAQ or objection-handling section.

### End of Page
Always end with a CTA—don't leave visitors at a dead end.

### Rhythm
One CTA per major section. Don't overwhelm, but don't make them hunt.

---

## CTA Don'ts

### Vague CTAs
```
❌ "Submit"
❌ "Click Here"  
❌ "Learn More" (overused)
❌ "Next"
❌ "Continue"
```

### Friction-Increasing Language
```
❌ "Sign Up" (implies commitment)
❌ "Register" (formal, bureaucratic)
❌ "Subscribe" (alone—implies ongoing cost)
❌ "Buy" (without context/value)
```

### Competing CTAs
```
❌ "Get Started" AND "Book Demo" AND "See Pricing" 
   (all same visual weight)

✓ One primary, one secondary (clearly different styling)
```

### CTA Without Supporting Text
```
❌ [Button alone on page]

✓ [Button] + "No credit card required. Cancel anytime."
```

## A/B Testing Priority

When testing CTAs, prioritize these variables:

### High Impact
1. **Action verb** (Get vs Start vs Claim)
2. **Benefit inclusion** (generic vs specific value)
3. **Risk reducer presence** (with vs without)

### Medium Impact
4. **First vs second person** (My vs Your)
5. **Supporting text** (different risk reducers)
6. **Button color/size** (visibility)

### Lower Impact
7. **Word order** (Start Free Trial vs Free Trial—Start Now)
8. **Capitalization** (Title Case vs Sentence case)
