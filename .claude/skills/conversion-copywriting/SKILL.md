# Conversion Copywriting Skill

## Overview

Great copy isn't creative writing. It's strategic communication designed to move readers toward action. This skill provides the frameworks and formulas to write copy that converts consistently.

---

## Core Principle: The Message Hierarchy

Before writing ANY copy, establish the message hierarchy:

```
LEVEL 1: PRIMARY MESSAGE
What's the ONE thing they must understand?
└── This becomes your headline

LEVEL 2: SUPPORTING MESSAGES
What 3-4 points prove or expand the primary?
└── These become your body copy sections

LEVEL 3: PROOF POINTS
What evidence makes each message believable?
└── These become testimonials, stats, credentials

LEVEL 4: ACTION
What's the ONE thing they should do?
└── This becomes your CTA
```

**Rule:** If you can't articulate each level in one sentence, you're not ready to write.

## Framework 1: Awareness-Level Writing

Copy must match where the reader is in their journey.

### The Five Levels

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ UNAWARE                                                         │

│ Copy Strategy:                                                  │
│ • Lead with surprising fact or relatable scenario               │
│ • Create problem recognition                                    │

### Awareness Matching Checklist

Before writing, ask:
- [ ] What awareness level is this page targeting?
- [ ] Does my headline match that level?
- [ ] Am I asking for appropriate commitment?
- [ ] Is my proof relevant to their stage?

---

## Framework 2: The PASTOR Method

For longer-form copy, use PASTOR:

```
P - PROBLEM
    Identify and articulate the reader's pain
    "You're spending 10 hours a week on manual data entry..."

A - AMPLIFY
    Agitate the consequences of not solving it
    "Every hour you waste is an hour not spent on growth..."

S - STORY / SOLUTION
    Introduce the solution (often through story)
    "That's why we built [Product]—to handle the busywork..."

T - TRANSFORMATION
    Paint the picture of life after
    "Imagine reclaiming those 10 hours every week..."

O - OFFER
    Present what they get (features → benefits)
    "You get automatic syncing, smart templates, and..."

R - RESPONSE
    Clear call to action with urgency
    "Start your free trial today—no credit card required."
```

---

## Framework 3: Feature → Benefit → Meaning

Never list features. Transform them:

```
FEATURE
What it is
↓
BENEFIT  
What it does for them
↓
MEANING
Why that matters emotionally

EXAMPLE:

Feature: "256-bit encryption"
         ↓
Benefit: "Your data is protected from hackers"
         ↓
Meaning: "Sleep soundly knowing your customers' 
         information is safe"
```

### The "So You Can" Bridge

Simple formula to convert features to benefits:

```
[Feature] so you can [benefit]

Examples:
- "Automated backups so you can never lose your work"
- "One-click deployment so you can ship faster"
- "Real-time analytics so you can make better decisions"
```

### The "Which Means" Chain

Go deeper into emotional meaning:

```
[Feature] which means [benefit] which means [emotional outcome]

Example:
"Our platform handles all the infrastructure"
which means "your team spends zero time on DevOps"
which means "you can finally focus on building features your customers actually want"
```

---

## Framework 4: Objection Handling in Copy

Every piece of copy should anticipate and neutralize objections.

### Objection Handling Patterns

**Direct Address:**
```
"You might be wondering: [exact objection]"
"Here's the truth: [counter-argument + proof]"
```

**Preemptive Strike:**
```
"Unlike other [category] that [common problem],
we [how you're different]."
```

**Social Proof Answer:**
```
"[Customer name] had the same concern.
Here's what happened: [result]"
```

**Risk Reversal:**
```
"Still not sure? Try it free for 30 days.
If you're not [specific outcome], we'll refund every penny."
```

### Placement Strategy

```
Objection Type → Where to Address

"Is it worth the price?"    → Near pricing, with value justification
"Will it work for me?"      → In proof section, with relevant testimonials  
"Is it hard to use?"        → After features, with simplicity proof
"Can I trust this company?" → Early, with credentials and social proof
"What if it doesn't work?"  → Near CTA, with guarantee
```

---

## Framework 5: Voice Adaptation

Copy must sound like the brand. Use voice dimensions to calibrate:

### Formality Scale

```
FORMAL (8-10)                    CASUAL (1-3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────
"We are pleased to offer..."  vs  "Here's the deal..."
"Clients may expect..."       vs  "You'll get..."
"One might consider..."       vs  "Think about it..."
"The organization..."         vs  "We" / "Our team"
```

### Warmth Scale

```
WARM (8-10)                      COOL (1-3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────
"We understand how hard..."   vs  "The data shows..."
"You deserve better..."       vs  "Results matter..."
"We're here to help..."       vs  "The solution works..."
"It can feel overwhelming..." vs  "It's inefficient..."
```

### Enthusiasm Scale

```
HIGH (8-10)                      LOW (1-3)
────────────────────────────────────────────────
"This changes everything!"    vs  "This is effective."
"You'll love how..."          vs  "You'll notice..."
"Amazing results..."          vs  "Solid results..."
"Finally!"                    vs  "Now available."
```

### Voice Calibration Checklist

Before writing:
- [ ] What's the formality level? (affects vocabulary, sentence structure)
- [ ] What's the warmth level? (affects emotional vs. logical emphasis)
- [ ] What's the enthusiasm level? (affects intensity, exclamations)
- [ ] What words are forbidden? (check voice profile)
- [ ] Any phrases to emulate? (check examples)

---

## Framework 6: The Specificity Principle

Vague copy doesn't convert. Specific copy does.

### The Specificity Test

```
VAGUE                           SPECIFIC
────────────────────────────────────────────────
"Save time"                  →  "Save 10 hours per week"
"Many customers"             →  "3,847 customers"
"Great results"              →  "37% increase in conversions"
"Easy to use"                →  "Set up in under 5 minutes"
"Fast support"               →  "Average response: 4 hours"
"Affordable"                 →  "$49/month"
```

### Where Specificity Matters Most

1. **Headlines** — Specific beats generic every time
2. **Claims** — Every claim needs a specific proof point
3. **CTAs** — "Get Your Custom Report" beats "Submit"
4. **Testimonials** — Results with numbers beat general praise
5. **Guarantees** — "30-day money back" beats "satisfaction guaranteed"

---

## Framework 7: Copy Structure Patterns

### The AIDA Structure (Classic)

```
ATTENTION: Headline grabs them
INTEREST: Subhead/first paragraph builds curiosity  
DESIRE: Body copy creates want
ACTION: CTA tells them what to do
```

### The PAS Structure (Problem-Focused)

```
PROBLEM: Identify the pain
AGITATION: Make it feel urgent
SOLUTION: Present your answer
```

### The BAB Structure (Transformation-Focused)

```
BEFORE: Their current painful state
AFTER: The desired future state
BRIDGE: How you get them there
```

### The 4 Ps Structure (Logical)

```
PROMISE: What they'll get
PICTURE: Paint the vision
PROOF: Evidence it works
PUSH: Call to action
```

---

## Headline Writing Rules

### Rule 1: Lead with the Benefit
```
✗ "Our New Software Platform"
✓ "Ship Code 3x Faster"
```

### Rule 2: Be Specific
```
✗ "Save Money on Your Bills"
✓ "Cut Your Energy Bills by 37%"
```

### Rule 3: Create Curiosity or Promise Value
```
Curiosity: "The One Mistake Killing Your Conversions"
Value: "Get More Leads Without Spending More on Ads"
```

### Rule 4: Match Awareness Level
```
Unaware: "Did you know..."
Problem-aware: "Tired of..."
Solution-aware: "Unlike other..."
Product-aware: "Here's proof..."
Most-aware: "Get started..."
```

### Rule 5: Test Alternatives
Always write 3+ headline options:
- One benefit-focused
- One curiosity-focused  
- One proof-focused

---

## CTA Writing Rules

### Rule 1: Start with a Verb
```
✗ "Free Trial"
✓ "Start Your Free Trial"
```

### Rule 2: Imply the Benefit
```
✗ "Submit"
✓ "Get My Custom Report"
```

### Rule 3: Match Commitment Level
```
High commitment (buy): "Start My Subscription"
Medium commitment (demo): "Book My Free Demo"
Low commitment (learn): "See How It Works"
```

### Rule 4: Reduce Anxiety
```
Add supporting text:
"Start Free Trial"
↓
"Start Free Trial — No credit card required"
```

### Rule 5: Use First Person
```
✗ "Start Your Trial"
✓ "Start My Trial"
(First person often outperforms second person)
```
