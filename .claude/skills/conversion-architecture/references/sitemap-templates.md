# Sitemap Templates by Business Type

## How to Use These Templates

These templates are starting points, not prescriptions. Every site should be customized based on:
1. ICP research (what do THEY need?)
2. Business goals (what conversion matters?)
3. Content availability (what can you actually create?)

Use these to spark thinking, then adapt.

## Red Flags in Site Structure

### Too Many Top-Level Pages
If you have 10+ items competing for primary nav, you're not prioritizing.

### No Clear Conversion Path
If someone asked "where do I buy/signup/contact?", could they answer in 2 seconds?

### Missing Trust Elements
No testimonials, case studies, or social proof visible = no conversion.

### Orphan Pages
Pages with no internal links leading to them = invisible pages.

### Duplicate Purpose
Two pages serving the same job = confusing and diluting.
