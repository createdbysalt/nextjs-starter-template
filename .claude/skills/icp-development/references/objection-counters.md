# Objection Counter-Argument Templates

## How to Use This Reference

Every objection has:
1. **Surface objection** — What they say
2. **Root fear** — What they actually mean
3. **Counter-argument** — How to address the root
4. **Proof needed** — What would convince them

Counter the ROOT, not the surface.

## Usage Notes

### When Documenting Objections in ICP

For each objection, capture:
```json
{
  "objection": {
    "surface": "What they say",
    "root_fear": "What they mean",
    "counter_strategy": "Which approach",
    "counter_arguments": ["Specific responses"],
    "proof_needed": ["What would convince them"],
    "evidence": "Where we learned this objection exists",
    "confidence": "STATED|INFERRED|HYPOTHESIS"
  }
}
```

### Matching Objections to Awareness Level

| Awareness Level | Common Objections |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Problem-Aware | "Is this really a priority?" |
| Solution-Aware | "How is this different from X?" |
| Product-Aware | Price, trust, time, fit |
| Most Aware | Timing, specific deal terms |

Address objections appropriate to their awareness level.
