# High-Expectation Customer (HXC)

## Source

## The Concept

The High-Expectation Customer is the most discerning member of your target market. They:
- Have the highest expectations for the product
- Will push for the best possible solution
- Represent the sharpest version of the user need
- When satisfied, broader users will also be satisfied

## Why It Matters

**Don't try to please everyone.** Superhuman explicitly ignores users who will never love the product and obsesses over their HXC.

If you design for the average user, you get average results. If you design for the HXC, you get exceptional results.

## How to Identify Your HXC

### 1. Use the Sean Ellis Survey
Ask: "How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"
- Very disappointed
- Somewhat disappointed
- Not disappointed

**Focus on the "very disappointed" users.** Study who they are.

### 2. Describe Them Vividly
Not "users" - a real person you can picture.

**Bad:**
> "Freelancers who want to manage clients"

**Good:**
> "Solo creative director running a $200-500k/year studio, juggling 3-5 active
> clients, using a mess of Notion + Calendly + email. They're drowning in admin
> but refuse to hire because they want to stay lean. They'd pay premium for
> anything that saves them 5+ hours/week. They say things like 'I just want
> to do the creative work' and 'I'm not a business person, I'm a designer.'"

### 3. Use Their Language
Quote them directly. Use the words they use, not industry jargon.

## Superhuman's Process

1. **Segment** to find who loves you most
2. **Analyze** what the "very disappointed" users love
3. **Study** "somewhat disappointed" users whose stated benefit matches your core value
4. **Build** 50% on amplifying what lovers love, 50% on converting fence-sitters
5. **Track** "very disappointed %" as north star metric

## Application in Salt-Core

When using `/problem`, define your HXC with:
- Who specifically would be devastated without this?
- What do they say about this problem in their own words?
- Why are they the right customer to design for?

## Anti-Patterns

**❌ "Our users are everyone who needs project management"**
Too broad. You'll build for no one.

**❌ "Small business owners"**
Still too broad. Which small business owners? What makes them distinctive?

**❌ Describing demographics instead of psychographics**
"25-45 year olds in urban areas" tells you nothing about their needs.

## Key Quote

> "If you only double down on what users love, your product-market fit score won't increase. You have to also convert people who are on the fence."
