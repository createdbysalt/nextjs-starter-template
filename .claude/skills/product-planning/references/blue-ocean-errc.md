# Blue Ocean Strategy: ERRC Framework

## Source
W. Chan Kim & Renée Mauborgne, "Blue Ocean Strategy"

## The Concept

**Blue Ocean vs. Red Ocean:**
- **Red Ocean:** Compete in existing market space. Beat the competition. Exploit existing demand. Make the value-cost tradeoff.
- **Blue Ocean:** Create uncontested market space. Make the competition irrelevant. Create and capture new demand. Break the value-cost tradeoff.

The ERRC Grid (Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create) is the action framework for creating blue oceans.

## The ERRC Grid

| Action | Question | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Eliminate** | Which factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated? | Remove features that no longer create value |
| **Reduce** | Which factors should be reduced well below industry standard? | Cut over-delivery on low-value dimensions |
| **Raise** | Which factors should be raised well above industry standard? | Exceed expectations on high-value dimensions |
| **Create** | Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered? | Introduce new sources of value |

## Why ERRC Works

Traditional strategy asks: "How do we beat competitors?"
Blue Ocean asks: "How do we make competitors irrelevant?"

**The key insight:** You don't have to choose between differentiation and low cost. By eliminating and reducing on some factors, you free up resources to raise and create on others.

```
Traditional Thinking:
Higher value = Higher cost
Lower cost = Lower value

Blue Ocean Thinking:
Eliminate + Reduce → Lower cost
Raise + Create → Higher value
BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY
```

## How to Use ERRC

### Step 1: Map the Industry Factors
List all factors the industry competes on:
- Features
- Service levels
- Pricing models
- Distribution channels
- Marketing approaches

### Step 2: Ask the Four Questions

**Eliminate:**
- What do we do because "that's how it's always been done"?
- What do customers not actually value?
- What creates unnecessary complexity?

**Reduce:**
- Where are we over-delivering?
- What do competitors obsess over that customers don't care about?
- Where do diminishing returns kick in?

**Raise:**
- What do customers complain about industry-wide?
- Where is the industry under-delivering?
- What would delight customers if we excelled at it?

**Create:**
- What do customers need that no one offers?
- What adjacent industries solve that ours doesn't?
- What pain points does everyone accept as "just how it is"?

### Step 3: Apply to Your Strategy

## Famous Examples

### Cirque du Soleil
| Action | Traditional Circus | Cirque du Soleil |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Eliminate** | Star performers, animal shows, aisle concessions | No animals, no star performers |
| **Reduce** | Fun and humor, thrill and danger | Less slapstick, more artistic |
| **Raise** | Unique venue | Theatrical setting, multiple productions |
| **Create** | Nothing new | Theme, artistic music/dance, elegant environment |

**Result:** Created new market space between circus and theater.

### Southwest Airlines
| Action | Traditional Airlines | Southwest |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Eliminate** | Meals, lounges, seat classes, hub connections | No frills |
| **Reduce** | Price | Significantly lower |
| **Raise** | Friendly service, speed, frequency | Best in class |
| **Create** | Point-to-point routes, 15-min turnaround | Industry first |

**Result:** Made flying accessible to those who previously drove.

## Application in Salt-Core

### ERRC Analysis vs. GoHighLevel

| Action | GoHighLevel | Salt Core |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Eliminate** | - | All-in-one lock-in, white-label complexity, template-first building |
| **Reduce** | - | Breadth of features (do fewer things better) |
| **Raise** | - | Code ownership, performance, strategic intelligence |
| **Create** | - | Unified strategic + technical intelligence, composable architecture |

### ERRC Analysis vs. Agency Operations Tools (Queue, SuperOkay)

| Action | Queue/SuperOkay | Salt Core |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Eliminate** | - | Assumption you already win premium clients |
| **Reduce** | - | Generic project management (not our core) |
| **Raise** | - | Professional delivery (The Bridge), designer-developer focus |
| **Create** | - | Strategic intelligence (win the project), technical optimization (keep the client) |

### In `/ideate`
For each competitor, generate an ERRC grid:

```
## ERRC vs. [Competitor]

### Eliminate
- [What they do that we won't]

### Reduce
- [What they over-invest in that we'll do less of]

### Raise
- [What they under-deliver on that we'll excel at]

### Create
- [What we'll offer that they don't]
```

## The Strategy Canvas

The visual complement to ERRC is the Strategy Canvas—a line graph showing how competitors score on key factors.

**Value Curve Analysis:**
- Where do competitors cluster? (Red ocean)
- Where is white space? (Blue ocean opportunity)
- What's your unique value curve?

## Common ERRC Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Only Raising and Creating
```
❌ WRONG: "Let's do everything they do PLUS more"
   → Higher costs, no focus, no differentiation

✓ RIGHT: Eliminate and Reduce to fund Raise and Create
   → Break the value-cost tradeoff
```

### Mistake 2: Eliminating What Customers Value
```
❌ WRONG: "Let's eliminate support to save money"
   → Customers need support

✓ RIGHT: Eliminate what the INDUSTRY takes for granted that CUSTOMERS don't value
   → E.g., Cirque eliminated animals (expensive, controversial) that audiences didn't need
```

### Mistake 3: Incremental Improvements
```
❌ WRONG: "Raise quality by 10%"
   → Still competing in the same space

✓ RIGHT: "Raise quality so dramatically that we're in a different category"
   → Redefine what quality means
```

### Mistake 4: Copying Competitor ERRC
```
❌ WRONG: "They eliminated X, so we will too"
   → You're following, not leading

✓ RIGHT: Derive YOUR ERRC from YOUR customers and YOUR strategy
   → Your blue ocean is unique to you
```

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**ERRC + Kano Model:**
- Eliminate: Remove features that became "reverse" (annoy users)
- Reduce: Dial back over-engineered "performance" features
- Raise: Invest heavily in "must-haves" that competitors neglect
- Create: Introduce new "delighters"

**ERRC + JTBD:**
- Eliminate: Features that don't serve any job
- Reduce: Features that over-serve a job
- Raise: Features that under-serve important jobs
- Create: Address jobs no one else addresses

**ERRC + OST:**
- Run ERRC on each opportunity in your tree
- Use ERRC to generate solutions

## Anti-Patterns

**❌ Me-too with a twist:** Doing everything competitors do plus one thing

**❌ Racing to the bottom:** Only eliminating and reducing (commodity play)

**❌ Kitchen sink:** Only raising and creating (cost explosion)

**❌ Analysis paralysis:** Spending months on ERRC instead of testing
