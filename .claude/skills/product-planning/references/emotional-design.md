# Three Levels of Emotional Design

## The Concept

Products evoke emotional responses at three levels. Loveable products satisfy all three:

| Level | What It Is | Timing | Design Question |
|-------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Visceral** | First impression, sensory response | Immediate | "Does it look/feel beautiful?" |
| **Behavioral** | Usability, effectiveness | During use | "Does it work smoothly?" |
| **Reflective** | Personal meaning, identity | After use | "Does it make me feel good about myself?" |

## Level 1: Visceral

**The immediate, gut reaction.** Before any thinking happens.

**What triggers it:**
- Visual beauty
- Satisfying sounds
- Smooth animations
- Material quality
- Typography and color

**Questions to ask:**
- What's the first impression?
- Does it feel premium or cheap?
- Is it visually distinctive?
- Do micro-animations feel polished?

**Examples:**
- Apple product unboxing
- Linear's smooth interface
- Stripe's elegant documentation

## Level 2: Behavioral

**The experience of using it.** Function and usability.

**What triggers it:**
- Accomplishing goals efficiently
- Intuitive interactions
- Responsive feedback
- Error prevention and recovery

**Questions to ask:**
- Is it easy to accomplish the task?
- Does it respond quickly?
- Are errors handled gracefully?
- Does it feel effortless?

**Examples:**
- Google search (instant, effective)
- Notion's flexible blocks
- Figma's real-time collaboration

## Level 3: Reflective

**The meaning and identity.** How it makes you feel about yourself.

**What triggers it:**
- Status and self-image
- Personal values alignment
- Pride of ownership
- Story you tell others

**Questions to ask:**
- Does using this make me feel professional?
- Am I proud to show this to others?
- Does it align with who I want to be?
- Would I tell people about it?

**Examples:**
- Tesla ownership (identity, values)
- Linear (feeling like a "real" product team)
- Superhuman (productivity identity)

## Why All Three Matter

| Level Missing | Result |
|---------------|--------|
| No Visceral | Functional but forgettable |
| No Behavioral | Beautiful but frustrating |
| No Reflective | Useful but no loyalty |

## Application in Salt-Core

### In `/solution`
For each solution option, specify:
- **Visceral:** First impression elements
- **Behavioral:** Interaction quality
- **Reflective:** Identity/meaning

### In `/prd`
For each user story, consider:
- What should the first impression be?
- How should the interaction feel?
- How should the user feel about themselves after?

### Example

**Feature:** Booking confirmation

**Visceral:** Clean layout, professional typography, subtle success animation

**Behavioral:** Instant confirmation, clear next steps, easy calendar add

**Reflective:** "I'm organized and professional. This was easy."

## Designing for Emotion

### Visceral Tips
- First 50ms matter most
- Invest in loading states
- Polish micro-animations
- Consistency creates trust

### Behavioral Tips
- Remove friction ruthlessly
- Provide immediate feedback
- Handle errors gracefully
- Make the happy path obvious

### Reflective Tips
- Understand user identity
- Align with their values
- Create shareable moments
- Build pride of ownership

## Anti-Patterns

**❌ Over-indexing on Visceral:** Beautiful but hard to use

**❌ Only Behavioral:** Functional but forgettable

**❌ Ignoring Reflective:** Useful but no emotional connection
