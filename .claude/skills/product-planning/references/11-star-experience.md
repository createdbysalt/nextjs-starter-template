## The Concept

Design for impossibly delightful, then work backward to find the feasible sweet spot.

| Stars | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Broken | Doesn't work at all |
| 3-4 | Bad | Works but frustrating |
| 5 | Expected | Standard, meets expectations |
| 6 | Good | Better than expected |
| 7 | Great | Notably impressive |
| 8 | Amazing | Tell-your-friends good |
| 9 | Incredible | Changes expectations |
| 10 | Unbelievable | Seems impossible |
| 11 | Magical | Absurdly, impossibly delightful |

## The Exercise

### Step 1: Define 5-Star (Baseline)
What's the expected, standard experience that meets basic requirements?

### Step 2: Extrapolate to 11-Star (Impossible Magic)
What would be absurdly, impossibly delightful? Go crazy. No constraints.

### Step 3: Work Backward to Sweet Spot (6-8 Stars)
What's the feasible magic you can actually ship?

## Example: Airbnb Check-in

**5-Star:** You book, you get an address, you find the key

**6-Star:** Host sends personal recommendations, easy key access

**7-Star:** Local guide greets you, shows you around, gives insider tips

**8-Star:** Personal concierge for your whole trip

**9-Star:** City is transformed to match your preferences

**10-Star:** Private jet picks you up

**11-Star:** Elon Musk picks you up and takes you to space

**Sweet Spot (7-star):** Enhanced local experience is feasible and remarkable

## Example: Meeting Booking

**5-Star:** Client can see availability and book a time

**6-Star:** Calendar auto-filters to their timezone, confirms instantly

**7-Star:** AI suggests optimal times based on project phase, auto-sends agenda

**8-Star:** System pre-briefs you on client before every call

**9-Star:** Virtual assistant handles all scheduling forever

**11-Star:** Teleportation - no meetings needed, instant communication

**Sweet Spot (7-star):** Smart timezone handling + instant confirmation is feasible and impressive

## Why It Works

1. **Forces ambition:** You can't design something remarkable if you start at 5-star
2. **Reveals the core value:** What would truly delight reveals what matters most
3. **Finds the sweet spot:** 11-star is impossible, but it shows the direction
4. **Creates word-of-mouth:** 5-star gets used. 7-8 star gets recommended.

## Application in Salt-Core

When using `/solution`:
1. Define what 5-star looks like for this feature
2. Go crazy imagining 11-star
3. Work backward to find 6-8 star that's feasible
4. Make that your target

## Key Question

**"What would make users tell EVERYONE about this?"**

If the answer is "nothing special," you're at 5-star. Push higher.

## Anti-Patterns

**❌ Stopping at 5-star:** "It works" isn't enough

**❌ Insisting on 11-star:** Impossible is impossible. Find the sweet spot.

**❌ Not doing the exercise:** Skipping straight to implementation misses the insight
