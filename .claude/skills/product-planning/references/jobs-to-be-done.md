# Jobs to be Done (JTBD)

## The Concept

People don't buy products - they hire them to do a job. Understanding the job, not the product, is the key to innovation.

Every job has three dimensions:
- **Functional:** The practical task they're trying to accomplish
- **Emotional:** How they want to feel during and after
- **Social:** How they want to be perceived by others

## The Job Story Format

### Functional Job
**When** [situation],
**I want to** [action],
**So I can** [outcome].

Example: "When I close a new client, I want them to book a kickoff call instantly, so I can maintain momentum while they're excited."

### Emotional Job
**When** [situation],
**I want to feel** [emotion],
**So I can** [psychological benefit].

Example: "When managing multiple clients, I want to feel in control and organized, so I can show up confidently to calls instead of scrambling."

### Social Job
**When** [situation],
**I want to be seen as** [perception],
**So I can** [social benefit].

Example: "When a client books with me, I want to be seen as professional and established, so they feel confident they made the right choice."

## Why All Three Matter

Most specs only capture functional jobs. But:
- Emotional jobs drive satisfaction and loyalty
- Social jobs drive word-of-mouth and premium pricing
- A product that nails all three creates love, not just use

## How to Discover Jobs

### 1. Interview Users
Focus on recent experiences, not hypotheticals:
- "Tell me about the last time you..."
- "Walk me through what happened..."
- "How did that make you feel?"

### 2. Look for Workarounds
What are users cobbling together to get the job done?
The more painful the workaround, the stronger the job.

### 3. Listen for Emotional Language
- "Frustrating," "stressful," "embarrassing" = emotional job not satisfied
- "Proud," "confident," "relieved" = emotional job satisfied

## Application in Salt-Core

When using `/problem`:
1. Identify the primary functional job
2. Dig for the emotional job underneath
3. Consider the social job (how do they want to appear?)
4. Design for all three in `/solution` and `/prd`

## vs. User Stories

**User Story:** "As a user, I want to book meetings"
- Says what, not why
- Functional only
- Feature-focused

**Job Story:** "When I close a new client, I want them to book a kickoff call instantly, so I can maintain momentum"
- Says when and why
- Reveals emotional context
- Outcome-focused

## Anti-Patterns

**❌ Feature-first thinking:** "We need a calendar integration"
**✅ Job-first thinking:** "Users need to book calls without friction to maintain momentum"

**❌ Functional only:** "I want to schedule meetings"
**✅ All three jobs:** "I want to schedule meetings (functional) feeling in control (emotional) appearing professional (social)"

**❌ Hypothetical jobs:** "Users might want..."
**✅ Observed jobs:** "When users tried to X, they said Y and felt Z"
