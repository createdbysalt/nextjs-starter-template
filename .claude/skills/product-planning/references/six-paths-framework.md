# Six Paths Framework

## The Concept

The Six Paths Framework helps you look beyond your immediate competitive landscape to find blue ocean opportunities. Instead of looking at competitors, you look **across boundaries** that define your industry.

Most companies compete by:
- Focusing on rivals within their industry
- Competing within their strategic group
- Targeting the same buyer group
- Similar scope of products/services
- Same functional-emotional orientation
- Focusing on the same point in time

The Six Paths help you systematically explore alternatives.

## The Six Paths

### Path 1: Look Across Alternative Industries

**Question:** What industries do customers consider as alternatives to yours?

**Insight:** Customers don't choose between competitors—they choose between alternatives that serve the same purpose.

**Example:**
- A movie theater doesn't just compete with other theaters
- It competes with Netflix, restaurants, video games, and staying home
- What does each alternative offer that you don't?

**For Salt Core:**
- Alternative: Hiring a fractional COO
- Alternative: DIY spreadsheets and Notion templates
- Alternative: Business coaching programs
- Alternative: Agency consultants

**Questions to ask:**
- Why do customers choose alternatives over our category?
- What do alternatives offer that we don't?
- What pain points do alternatives create that we could solve?

### Path 2: Look Across Strategic Groups

**Question:** What strategic groups exist within your industry, and what drives customers to trade up or down?

**Definition:** Strategic groups are companies within an industry that pursue similar strategies (premium vs. budget, specialized vs. general, etc.)

**Example:**
- Luxury hotels vs. budget hotels vs. Airbnb
- What makes someone choose boutique over chain?
- What would make budget travelers upgrade?

**For Salt Core:**
- Enterprise agency tools (HubSpot) vs. SMB tools (GHL) vs. Solo tools (Bonsai)
- What makes someone choose enterprise over SMB?
- What do solo practitioners need that SMB tools don't provide?

**Questions to ask:**
- What strategic groups exist in our space?
- Why do buyers trade up to higher groups?
- Why do buyers trade down to lower groups?
- What if we could offer the best of both?

### Path 3: Look Across Buyer Groups

**Question:** Who actually makes, influences, and uses the purchase decision?

**The Chain of Buyers:**
- **Purchasers:** Who pays?
- **Users:** Who uses it?
- **Influencers:** Who shapes the decision?

**Insight:** Industries often focus on one buyer in the chain. Looking at others reveals new value.

**Example:**
- Insulin industry focused on doctors (influencers)
- Novo Nordisk focused on patients (users)
- Created the insulin pen for ease of use

**For Salt Core:**
- User: The studio owner
- Purchaser: Same (usually)
- Influencer: Their clients, their peers, their mentor/coach

**Questions to ask:**
- Who influences our users' decisions?
- What do their clients want that we could help deliver?
- What would make peers recommend us?

### Path 4: Look Across Complementary Products/Services

**Question:** What happens before, during, and after someone uses your product?

**Insight:** Your product exists in a broader context. Solving adjacent problems creates new value.

**Example:**
- IKEA doesn't just sell furniture
- They solve "home setup": design, transport, assembly, disposal
- Each step is an opportunity

**For Salt Core:**
- Before: Winning the client (proposals, positioning)
- During: Delivering the work (projects, communication)
- After: Maintaining the relationship (retainers, upsells)

**Questions to ask:**
- What do users do before they use our product?
- What pain points exist during complementary activities?
- What happens after they stop using us?

### Path 5: Look Across Functional-Emotional Orientation

**Question:** Does your industry compete on function or emotion? What if you shifted?

**Insight:** Some industries compete on rational benefits (function). Others compete on feelings (emotion). The opposite orientation is often untapped.

**Example:**
- Swiss watch industry competed on emotion (luxury, status)
- Swatch competed on function AND emotion (affordable, fun, collectible)
- Created a new market

**For Salt Core:**
- Industry: Mostly functional (features, efficiency, cost savings)
- Opportunity: Emotional appeal (confidence, identity, pride)

**Questions to ask:**
- Does our industry primarily appeal to function or emotion?
- What emotions are untapped in our category?
- What functional benefits are we ignoring while chasing emotion?

### Path 6: Look Across Time

**Question:** What trends are reshaping what buyers value?

**Insight:** Value evolves over time. Trends that are clear today will define tomorrow's buyers.

**Key criteria for trends:**
- Decisive to your business
- Irreversible
- Clear trajectory

**Example:**
- Apple saw the trend toward legal digital music
- Created iTunes when others fought piracy
- Rode the wave instead of resisting it

**For Salt Core:**
- Trend: AI-assisted development becoming mainstream
- Trend: Designer-developer hybrid role growing
- Trend: Remote/solo studios replacing agencies
- Trend: Clients expecting data-backed decisions

**Questions to ask:**
- What trends are irreversible?
- How will these trends change what buyers value?
- What can we create today that positions us for tomorrow?

## Applying the Six Paths

### Structured Exploration

For each path, ask:

```
PATH: [Alternative Industries / Strategic Groups / Buyer Groups / etc.]

1. What alternatives/groups/buyers exist?
   - [List them]

2. What do they offer that we don't?
   - [List insights]

3. What pain points do they create?
   - [List opportunities]

4. What blue ocean idea emerges?
   - [Specific idea]
```

### Salt Core Example: Path 5 Deep Dive

**Path 5: Functional-Emotional Orientation**

**Current Industry State:**
Agency/studio tools compete on function:
- "Save 10 hours per week"
- "Manage unlimited projects"
- "Automate your invoicing"

**Emotional Opportunity:**
Designer-developers have intense emotional needs:
- Validation that their hybrid identity is legitimate
- Confidence to charge premium rates
- Pride in running a "real" studio

**Blue Ocean Idea:**
Position Salt Core not just as "efficient operations" but as "the studio you're proud to run." Every feature reinforces the identity transformation from "freelancer who codes" to "strategic studio owner."

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Staying Within Your Lane
```
❌ WRONG: Only comparing to direct competitors
✓ RIGHT: Looking at alternatives, adjacent industries, different buyer groups
```

### Mistake 2: Surface-Level Analysis
```
❌ WRONG: "Path 1: There are other tools"
✓ RIGHT: "Path 1: DIY spreadsheets are an alternative because they're free and customizable. Pain: no automation, no professional appearance. Opportunity: templates that feel custom."
```

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Emotional Paths
```
❌ WRONG: Only analyzing functional alternatives
✓ RIGHT: Asking "What emotional job does each alternative serve?"
```

### Mistake 4: Not Taking Action
```
❌ WRONG: Six Paths as theoretical exercise
✓ RIGHT: Each path generates specific, testable ideas
```

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**Six Paths + ERRC:**
- Each path reveals what to Eliminate, Reduce, Raise, Create
- Path insights become ERRC actions

**Six Paths + JTBD:**
- Each path reveals different jobs customers are hiring solutions for
- Adjacent industries = adjacent jobs

**Six Paths + Kano:**
- Path 5 (emotional) often reveals delighter opportunities
- Path 4 (complementary) reveals must-have gaps

## Anti-Patterns

**❌ Checking boxes:** Going through paths mechanically without genuine exploration

**❌ Staying comfortable:** Only exploring paths that confirm existing strategy

**❌ Ignoring paths:** Skipping paths that seem "not relevant" (they often are)

**❌ Analysis without synthesis:** Not connecting path insights to concrete opportunities
