## How to Use This Reference

Consistent severity levels are crucial for actionable audits. Use these examples to calibrate your severity assignments. When in doubt, ask: "Would I delay launch for this?"

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL Severity

**Definition:** Will significantly hurt conversion. Must fix before launch.

**Criteria:**
- Affects primary conversion path
- Prevents or severely blocks conversion
- Fundamental trust or clarity issue
- Would cause immediate bounce/abandonment

### Critical Examples

```
EXAMPLE 1: Missing Primary CTA
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Product page has no "Buy" button or way to purchase
Impact: Visitors literally cannot convert
Why Critical: Primary conversion path is broken
Fix: Add CTA button above fold and at key decision points
```

```
EXAMPLE 2: Value Proposition Absent
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Homepage headline is "Welcome to TechCorp" with no 
         explanation of what the company does
Impact: Visitors leave within 5 seconds, don't know if relevant
Why Critical: Fails the 5-second clarity test
Fix: Replace with benefit-focused headline + supporting subhead
```

```
EXAMPLE 3: Trust Killer Design
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Site looks outdated/broken - misaligned elements, 
         broken images, inconsistent styling
Impact: Visitors don't trust site with their information or money
Why Critical: Fundamental credibility issue
Fix: Design overhaul or at minimum fix broken elements
```

```
EXAMPLE 4: Broken Conversion Flow
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: "Add to Cart" button doesn't work / form doesn't submit
Impact: 100% of conversion attempts fail
Why Critical: Technical blocker to conversion
Fix: Fix functionality immediately
```

```
EXAMPLE 5: No Way to Buy/Contact
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Service page describes offering but has no CTA, 
         no contact form, no phone number, no next step
Impact: Interested visitors have nowhere to go
Why Critical: Dead end at key conversion moment
Fix: Add appropriate conversion mechanism
```

```
EXAMPLE 6: Major ICP Objection Unaddressed (Trust)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: ICP's #1 objection is "Is this legit or a scam?"
         but site has zero testimonials, no about page, 
         no credentials, no contact info
Impact: Target audience won't convert due to trust barrier
Why Critical: Directly prevents conversion for primary audience
Fix: Add comprehensive trust signals before launch
```

---

## 🟠 HIGH Severity

**Definition:** Likely hurting conversion. Fix in first iteration.

**Criteria:**
- Affects conversion rate but doesn't completely block
- Important trust or clarity gap
- Significant friction in user journey
- Would cause measurable conversion loss

### High Examples

```
EXAMPLE 1: Generic CTA Copy
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: All CTAs say "Submit" or "Click Here"
Impact: Doesn't communicate value, reduces click motivation
Why High: Proven to hurt conversion rates 20-40%
Fix: Change to benefit-focused copy ("Get My Free Quote")
```

```
EXAMPLE 2: Objection Not Addressed
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: ICP has price objection ("Is it worth it?") but 
         no value justification, ROI examples, or comparison
Impact: Price-sensitive segment abandons
Why High: Known conversion barrier for target audience
Fix: Add value justification content near pricing
```

```
EXAMPLE 3: CTA Below Fold
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Primary CTA only appears after scrolling past 
         2000px of content
Impact: Visitors ready to act can't easily do so
Why High: Friction for motivated visitors
Fix: Add CTA above fold and repeat at intervals
```

```
EXAMPLE 4: No Social Proof on Key Pages
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Product and pricing pages have zero testimonials,
         reviews, or logos
Impact: Nothing validates claims or reduces risk
Why High: Significantly reduces trust at decision point
Fix: Add relevant testimonials near CTAs
```

```
EXAMPLE 5: Form Too Long
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Newsletter signup requires 8 fields
Impact: Most visitors abandon (each field = ~7% drop)
Why High: Quantifiable conversion loss
Fix: Reduce to email only, get other info later
```

```
EXAMPLE 6: Mobile CTA Unreachable
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Primary CTA is 20px and at top of screen 
         (outside thumb zone)
Impact: Mobile users (50%+ of traffic) struggle to convert
Why High: Major friction for large segment
Fix: Sticky CTA at bottom of screen, larger touch target
```

```
EXAMPLE 7: Weak Value Proposition
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Headline is "We help businesses grow" - generic,
         could be any competitor
Impact: No differentiation, no reason to choose you
Why High: Doesn't give visitors reason to stay
Fix: Specific, differentiated value proposition
```

## 🟡 MEDIUM Severity

**Definition:** May be hurting conversion. Fix when possible.

**Criteria:**
- Suboptimal but not blocking
- Enhancement opportunity with evidence
- Secondary path friction
- Would improve conversion but not dramatically

### Medium Examples

```
EXAMPLE 1: Testimonials Are Generic
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Testimonials say "Great product!" without specifics
Impact: Social proof present but not compelling
Why Medium: Has proof, just weak proof
Fix: Replace with specific, results-focused testimonials
```

```
EXAMPLE 2: Missing FAQ Page
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Common objections not addressed at scale
Impact: Visitors with questions may not find answers
Why Medium: Primary content addresses main concerns
Fix: Add FAQ addressing top 10 objections
```

```
EXAMPLE 3: No Secondary CTA
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Only "Buy Now" option - no email capture for 
         not-ready visitors
Impact: Lose opportunity to nurture interested visitors
Why Medium: Primary conversion path works
Fix: Add email capture offer for research-stage visitors
```

```
EXAMPLE 4: Suboptimal CTA Placement
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: CTA appears after lengthy content but not after
         testimonial section
Impact: Missed conversion opportunity at high-trust moment
Why Medium: CTAs exist, just not optimally placed
Fix: Add CTA after social proof sections
```

```
EXAMPLE 5: Trust Signal Below Fold
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Logo bar and testimonials require significant scroll
Impact: Initial trust not established quickly
Why Medium: Trust signals exist, just poorly placed
Fix: Move at least one trust signal above fold
```

```
EXAMPLE 6: Form Labels Are Placeholder-Only
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Labels disappear when typing
Impact: Accessibility issue, minor friction
Why Medium: Form works, just suboptimal UX
Fix: Use visible labels above inputs
```

```
EXAMPLE 7: No Urgency Element
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: No reason to act now vs. later
Impact: May increase "I'll do it later" (and never return)
Why Medium: Visitors can still convert
Fix: Add authentic urgency where applicable
```

## 🟢 LOW Severity

**Definition:** Minor optimization opportunity. Nice to have.

**Criteria:**
- Minor polish or enhancement
- A/B test candidate
- Edge case improvements
- Marginal impact expected

### Low Examples

```
EXAMPLE 1: Button Could Be Larger
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: CTA button is 36px height vs recommended 44-48px
Impact: Slightly harder to tap, especially on mobile
Why Low: Works fine, minor improvement
Fix: Increase to 44-48px
```

```
EXAMPLE 2: Headline Could Be Stronger
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Headline is good but not great - benefit is clear
         but not emotionally compelling
Impact: Might improve engagement marginally
Why Low: Not broken, optimization opportunity
Fix: A/B test alternative headlines
```

```
EXAMPLE 3: Missing Progress Indicator
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: 3-step form doesn't show steps 1/2/3
Impact: Minor uncertainty about process length
Why Low: Form still works
Fix: Add progress indicator
```

```
EXAMPLE 4: No Animation/Microinteraction
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Buttons have no hover state feedback
Impact: Slightly less polished feel
Why Low: Functional, just not delightful
Fix: Add subtle hover states
```

```
EXAMPLE 5: Could Add Chat Widget
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Finding: Contact page has form but no live chat option

Finding: Testimonials are text-only, no photos
Impact: Slightly less impactful than with images
Why Low: Testimonials exist and are specific
Fix: Add customer photos where possible
```

## Calibration Questions

When assigning severity, ask:

### For CRITICAL consideration:
- Would you delay launch to fix this?
- Is the primary conversion path affected?
- Would this cause immediate bounce or abandonment?
- Is there a fundamental trust or clarity issue?

### For HIGH consideration:
- Does research/data show this hurts conversion?
- Is a known ICP objection going unaddressed?
- Is there significant friction at a key moment?
- Would you prioritize this in the first sprint post-launch?

### For MEDIUM consideration:
- Is this suboptimal but not blocking?
- Could this be better based on best practices?
- Is this secondary to the primary conversion path?
- Would you fix this in the second or third sprint?

### For LOW consideration:
- Is this a nice-to-have polish item?
- Would you A/B test this rather than just implement?
- Is the impact likely marginal?
- Is this an edge case or minor UX improvement?

## Common Calibration Mistakes

### Over-Criticaling
```
Mistake: Marking generic CTA copy as CRITICAL
Reality: CTAs exist and work - it's HIGH at most
Rule: CRITICAL means broken or impossible, not suboptimal
```

### Under-Severitying
```
Mistake: Marking "no value proposition" as MEDIUM
Reality: Visitors can't know if they're in the right place
Rule: Clarity issues are usually HIGH or CRITICAL
```

### Over-Nitpicking
```
Mistake: 50 issues, half are button colors or font sizes
Reality: These distract from real problems
Rule: If impact is marginal, it's LOW or don't include
```

### Missing Context
```
Mistake: Same severity for every "missing testimonial"
Reality: Missing on homepage is HIGH, missing on FAQ is LOW
Rule: Context determines impact determines severity
