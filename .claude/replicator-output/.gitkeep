# Replicator Output Directory

This directory contains temporary artifacts from the `/replicate` command.

## Structure

Each replication creates a project folder:

```
replicator-output/
└── [project-name]/
    ├── extraction/           # Style data, tokens, animation specs
    ├── screenshots/          # Original and prototype screenshots
    ├── validation/           # Validation reports
    └── components/           # Generated code (ready to copy)
```

## Usage

After `/replicate` completes:

1. Review components in `[project]/components/`
2. Copy to your feature: `cp -r [project]/components/* app/_features/[feature]/components/`
3. Add tokens: Copy `extraction/tailwind-tokens.css` contents to `app/globals.css`
4. Clean up: `rm -rf [project]/` when done

## Git

This directory is gitignored. Replication artifacts should not be committed.
