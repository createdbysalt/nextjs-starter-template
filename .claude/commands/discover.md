# /discover - Client Discovery Command

## Purpose
Initiate and execute a comprehensive client discovery process. This command orchestrates the client-discovery agent and brand-voice-extraction skill to produce a complete Client DNA package.

## When to Use
- Starting a new client project
- Onboarding a client you haven't worked with before
- Creating foundational documents for strategy work
- Preparing for copywriting or design that requires brand context

## Usage

```
/discover [input_description]
```

**Examples:**
```
/discover Process the intake form for Bloom Botanicals
/discover Analyze the attached questionnaire and website for Acme Corp
/discover Create Client DNA from the discovery call notes
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Input Assessment

First, identify what inputs are available:

**Check for:**
- Discovery questionnaire / intake form (uploaded or in project)
- Client website URL
- Brand guidelines document
- Stakeholder interview notes
- Existing marketing materials
- Competitor information

**If inputs are missing:**
→ List what's available
→ Recommend what additional inputs would improve quality
→ Offer to proceed with available materials (noting limitations)

### Step 2: Invoke Client Discovery Agent

Use the `client-discovery` agent to:
1. Catalog all inputs
2. Extract business information with source citations
3. Identify gaps and contradictions
4. Generate initial Client DNA structure

### Step 3: Invoke Brand Voice Extraction

Using the `brand-voice-extraction` skill:
1. Analyze any writing samples available
2. Score voice dimensions with evidence
3. Generate voice guidelines
4. Flag any voice inconsistencies

### Step 4: Compile Missing Info Manifest

Consolidate all gaps into a single manifest:
- Critical gaps that block work
- High-priority gaps that impact quality
- Medium and low priority items

### Step 5: Generate Outputs

Create four files in the outputs directory:

```
/mnt/user-data/outputs/1_discovery/
├── {client_name}_client_dna.json
├── {client_name}_voice_profile.json
├── {client_name}_missing_info.json
└── message-draft.md
```

### Step 6: Generate Client Message Draft

**ALWAYS** create a `message-draft.md` file that can be sent to the client. This message should:

1. **Confirm key decisions** made during discovery (voice, positioning, etc.)
2. **List items needed from client** with clear priority levels
3. **Include testimonial request template** if testimonials are needed
4. **Set expectations** for next steps

The message should be:
- Ready to copy/paste and send
- Professional but friendly tone
- Organized with clear sections
- Include specific asks with context on why they matter

### Step 7: Present Summary

Provide a concise summary including:
- Key findings (3-5 bullets)
- Confidence level (high/medium/low)
- Critical gaps requiring client input
- Recommended next steps

## Handling Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Only Questionnaire Available
```
Proceed with questionnaire analysis.
Note: "Voice profile confidence: LOW - no writing samples analyzed"
Recommend: "Request 2-3 samples of existing content for voice extraction"
```

### Scenario: Only Website Available
```
Proceed with website analysis.
Extract voice from website copy.
Note: "Business details limited to public information"
Recommend: "Request intake questionnaire for strategic context"
```

### Scenario: Contradictions Found
```
Document contradictions in Client DNA "contradictions_flagged" field.
Do NOT resolve contradictions by assumption.
Add to Missing Info as: "Clarification needed: [specific question]"
```

### Scenario: Client Says "Just Use Your Judgment"
```
Still document gaps.
Provide options rather than assumptions.
Note: "Client has authorized inference, but recommend validation before launch"
```

## Integration

This command produces outputs used by:
- `/icp` command (uses Client DNA for audience research)
- `/strategy` command (uses both DNA and Voice Profile)
- `/copy` command (uses Voice Profile for tone)
- `competitor-analysis` skill (uses competitive set from DNA)

Always save outputs to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` for downstream access.

## Example Interaction

**User:** `/discover Process the intake form I uploaded for GreenLeaf Organics`

**Agent Response:**

```
## Discovery Analysis: GreenLeaf Organics

### Inputs Analyzed
✓ Intake questionnaire (42 questions answered)
✗ Website not provided
✗ Writing samples not provided

### Key Findings
1. **Business**: Organic skincare, DTC model, founded 2021
2. **Positioning**: "Clean beauty without compromise" - premium tier
3. **Target**: Health-conscious women 28-45, urban/suburban
4. **Goals**: Increase AOV by 20%, launch subscription model
5. **Voice preference stated**: "Warm, knowledgeable, never preachy"

### Confidence Level: MEDIUM
- Business details: HIGH (comprehensive questionnaire)
- Voice profile: LOW (no writing samples to analyze)

### Critical Gaps
1. No existing content to extract actual voice (stated preference ≠ practice)
2. Competitor list mentioned but not provided
3. Customer testimonials referenced but not included

### Files Generated
- `greenleaf_organics_client_dna.json`
- `greenleaf_organics_voice_profile.json` (placeholder - needs samples)
- `greenleaf_organics_missing_info.json`
- `message-draft.md` (ready to send to client)

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Request 3-5 writing samples (emails, social posts, product descriptions)
2. Get competitor URLs for analysis
3. Obtain 5+ customer testimonials with permission to use
4. Schedule 15-min call to resolve positioning questions

Proceed with `/icp` when gaps are resolved, or continue with current data (noting limitations)?
