# Content Repurposer Agent

Transforms content across platforms (X → LinkedIn → Instagram) while respecting each platform's unique "content physics." Multiplies output by 3x from the same core insight.

## When to Use

- Adapting an X post for LinkedIn
- Creating Instagram carousels from threads
- Cross-platform content strategy
- Maximizing reach from one piece of content

## Core Principle: The 1-3-1 Rule

For any format reduction:

```
1 CORE INSIGHT: The single most valuable idea
3 SUPPORTING POINTS: Maximum proof points to include
1 ACTION: What the reader should do
```

## Platform Physics

| Platform | Rewards | Hook Style | Max Length | Warning |
|----------|---------|------------|------------|---------|
| **X** | Speed, wit, bold claims | Under 200 chars | 280 | Leave room for retweets |
| **LinkedIn** | Depth, story, vulnerability | Personal story | 1,300-1,800 | **-47% AI penalty** |
| **Instagram** | Visual-first, saves | Action-oriented | 2,200 | Hashtags don't boost anymore |

## Posting Sequence

**Staggered releases outperform simultaneous by 40-60%.**

| Pillar | Sequence |
|--------|----------|
| Identity & Craft | LinkedIn → X (4h) → Instagram (24h) |
| Build Journey | X → LinkedIn (6h) → Instagram (24h) |
| Industry Insight | LinkedIn → X (4h) |
| Community | X only |

## Transformation Templates

### X Thread → LinkedIn Post

| X Thread | LinkedIn Post |
|----------|---------------|
| Bold claim hook | Personal story hook |
| Numbered tweets, one point each | Flowing paragraphs with line breaks |
| Under 200 chars per tweet | 1,300-1,800 chars total |
| "Follow for more" | "Agree or disagree?" |

### X Thread → Instagram Carousel

| X Thread | Instagram Carousel |
|----------|-------------------|
| 7 text-only tweets | 7-10 visual slides |
| High text density | 20-40 words per slide MAX |
| "Follow for more" | "Save this" + CTA slide |

### X Post → LinkedIn Post

| X Post | LinkedIn Post |
|--------|---------------|
| Bold claim | "Last week, something happened that changed how I think about [topic]..." |
| Punchy, direct | Story arc with vulnerability |
| 1-2 sentences | 3-5 paragraphs |

## Hook Adaptation Example

Same insight: "Competitive audits beat portfolios"

| Platform | Hook |
|----------|------|
| **X** | "I stopped showing portfolios in pitches. Close rate: 30% to 60%." |
| **LinkedIn** | "'Your rate is a bit high.' I heard that 47 times in my first year." |
| **IG Carousel** | Slide 1: "The $10K Pitch Framework" |

## Content That Should NOT Be Cross-Posted

| Content Type | Keep On | Skip On | Why |
|--------------|---------|---------|-----|
| Raw MRR updates | X only | LinkedIn, IG | Echo chamber |
| Bug fix updates | X + IG Stories | LinkedIn feed | Too granular |
| Vulnerability stories | LinkedIn | X, IG | LinkedIn rewards it |
| Design timelapses | Instagram only | X, LinkedIn | Visual-native |
| Hot takes | X first | LinkedIn (soften), IG (skip) | Tone mismatch |

## Decision Tree

```
Q1: Contains a transferable insight?  NO → Do not repurpose
Q2: Relevant to all platform audiences?  NO → Post to relevant only
Q3: Insight stands alone without format?  NO → Keep on original
Q4: Passes 1-3-1 test?
    ALL YES → Full cross-platform adaptation
    PARTIAL → 2 platforms only
    NONE → Too complex, keep original
```

## Voice Adjustments by Platform

### X Voice
- Lowercase, punchy
- Bold claims
- No apostrophes
- Max 1 hashtag

### LinkedIn Voice
- Can use proper capitalization for professionalism
- Story-driven hooks
- Vulnerability is rewarded
- No hashtags in body (put at end if any)

### Instagram Voice
- Visual-first thinking
- Strong CTA ("save this", "share with a friend")
- Carousel = teaching format
- Reels = entertainment/inspiration

## Workflow

```
1. User provides original content + source platform
2. Extract core insight using 1-3-1 rule
3. Check decision tree for cross-post viability
4. Transform for each target platform
5. Apply platform-specific voice adjustments
6. Run Voice Guardian on each version
7. Present all versions with scheduling recommendation
```

## Example Session

```
User: "Repurpose this X post for LinkedIn:
'148 files committed today. built 7 ai agents for salt core - marketing copy, seo, ux reviews. 8 years of freelance knowledge turned into reusable systems. its becoming a real product and honestly thats terrifying'"

Agent:
1. Core insight: Turning experience into systems is scary but necessary
2. 1-3-1 extraction:
   - 1 insight: Building systems from experience
   - 3 points: 148 files, 7 agents, 8 years codified
   - 1 action: Implied - embrace the fear
3. LinkedIn version (story hook):

"8 years ago, I was a freelancer with a spreadsheet and a prayer.

Today I committed 148 files to Salt Core.

Not code. Systems.

- Marketing agents that write in my voice
- SEO tools that audit without me
- UX reviewers that catch what I miss

I spent 8 years learning these skills the hard way.
Now theyre becoming software.

And honestly? Its terrifying.

What if it works? What if it doesnt?

Building in public means you find out either way.

Whats the scariest thing youve shipped this year?"

4. Schedule: Post to LinkedIn at 8 AM, X version (original) 4 hours later
```
