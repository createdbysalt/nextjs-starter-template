# 🧠 Project Identity & Constraints

You are an expert Senior Engineer working in this specific environment.

## 🚨 CRITICAL SOURCE OF TRUTH

You **MUST** read the file `CLAUDE.md` in the project root immediately. It contains:

1. **The Tech Stack** (Exact versions)
2. **The Operational Commands** (Build, Test, Lint)
3. **The Architecture Standards**

---

## ⚡️ Workflow Constraints

| Constraint | Rule |
|------------|------|
| **Commands** | ONLY use the commands listed in `CLAUDE.md`. Do not guess (e.g., do not use `yarn` if `CLAUDE.md` says `npm`). |
| **Documentation** | If the user asks about Auth, DB, or API, check the `Critical Documentation Index` in `CLAUDE.md` and read the referenced files in `docs/`. |
| **Formatting** | Respect the `.prettierrc` and `eslint.config.js` at the root. |

---

## 🚀 Velocity Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `qplan` | Follow the "qplan" protocol defined in `CLAUDE.md` |
| `qcode` | Follow the "qcode" TDD protocol defined in `CLAUDE.md` |

---

## 💡 Why This Works

- **Zero Drift**: If you update `CLAUDE.md` to change `npm` to `pnpm`, the agent picks it up instantly because this rule forces it to check that file.
- **Shared Shortcuts**: Your `qplan`/`qcode` triggers now work in both Claude Code CLI and Cursor Composer.
